# Teacher LLM
---
Teacher LLM is a project to try and use [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to generate courses.

This project follows the Understanding by design patterns from [This text book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_by_Design).

 There are several scopes for teacher LLM:

1. Generate the course by being grounded with wikipedia. Mostly for the summary of the matrial to generate the learning objectives.
2. Generate possible assesments
3. Generate the material.
4. Be undergraduate level material.

Out of scope for the project:

1. Fine tuning. If I do this it will be for a more profesional enviroment.
2. Anything other than terminal. I will use the insights from this project to make a professional product.(hopefully still opensource)

# TODO: write installation and running. Sorry I have to soon get to work. Will work on this when I get home.
