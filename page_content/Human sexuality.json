Buss and David P. Schmitt</ref> Sociocultural aspects of sexuality include [[History of human sexuality|historical developments]] and [[Religion and sexuality|religious beliefs]]. Some cultures have been described as [[sexually repressive]]. The study of sexuality also includes human identity within social groups, [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), and [[birth control]] methods.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Development==\n===Sexual orientation===\n{{Main|Sexual orientation}}\n\nThere is considerably more evidence supporting innate causes of sexual orientation than learned ones, especially for males. This evidence includes the cross-cultural correlation of homosexuality and childhood [[gender nonconformity]], moderate genetic influences found in [[twin studies]], evidence for prenatal hormonal effects on brain organization, the [[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]], and the finding that in rare cases where infant males were raised as girls due to physical differences or deformity, they nevertheless turned out attracted to females. Hypothesized social causes are supported by only weak evidence, distorted by numerous confounding factors.<ref name=Bailey16 />\n\nCross-cultural evidence also leans more toward non-social causes. Cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it. Homosexual behavior is relatively common among boys in British single-sex boarding schools, but adult Britons who attended such schools are no more likely to engage in homosexual behavior than those who did not. In an extreme case, the [[Sambia people]] ritually require their boys to engage in homosexual behavior during adolescence before they have any access to females, yet most of these boys become heterosexual.<ref name=LeVay/><ref name=Balthazart/>\n\nIt is not fully understood why genes causing homosexuality persist in the gene pool. One hypothesis involves [[kin selection]], suggesting that homosexuals invest heavily enough in their relatives to offset the cost of not reproducing as much directly. This has not been supported by studies in Western cultures, but several studies in [[Samoa]] have found some support for this hypothesis. Another hypothesis involves [[Sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic]] genes, which cause homosexuality when expressed in males but increase reproduction when expressed in females. Studies in both Western and non-Western cultures have found support for this hypothesis.<ref name=Bailey16/><ref name=BussCh5>{{cite book |last=Buss |first=David |date=2019 |title=Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind |chapter=Men's Long-Term Mating Strategies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn6JDwAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0429590061 |access-date=10 July 2019 |archive-date=12 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200112131228/https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn6JDwAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Gender differences===\n{{see also|Sex differences in psychology#Sexual behavior}}\n\nPsychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of them (including [[neo-analytic]] theories, [[sociobiological]] theories, social learning theory, [[social role theory]], and [[script theory]]) agree in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as [[marriage]]) and should also be more [[promiscuous]] (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women. These theories are mostly consistent with observed differences in males' and females' attitudes toward casual sex before marriage in the United States. Other aspects of human sexuality, such as sexual satisfaction, incidence of [[oral sex]], and attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] and [[masturbation]], show little to no observed difference between males and females. Observed gender differences regarding the number of sexual partners are modest, with males tending to have slightly more than females.<ref name=\"Oliver & Hyde\">{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Mary Beth |last2=Hyde |first2=Janet S. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F. |title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings |date=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84169-019-3 |pages=29\u201343 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qsKNaqIsuUC&pg=PA29 |chapter=Gender Differences in Sexuality: A Meta-Analysis |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-date=24 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200524102421/https://books.google.com/books?id=2qsKNaqIsuUC&pg=PA29 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Biological and physiological aspects==\n{{main|Human reproductive system}}\nLike other [[mammal]]s, humans are primarily grouped into either the [[male]] or [[female]] sex.<ref name=\"Leonard2010\">{{cite book |last=Leonard |first=Janet |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=PgtXj5R6OfMC }} |title=The Evolution of Primary Sexual Characters in Animals |date=18 June 2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-532555-3 |page=552 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\nThe biological aspects of humans' sexuality deal with the reproductive system, the sexual response cycle, and the factors that affect these aspects.

It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/> The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDuring [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nThe ovaries (female gonads), develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only 400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nOvulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation.\n\nOn day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28\u2014the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle\u2014now called the [[corpus luteum]]\u2014secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Sexual response cycle===\nThe sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina. The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health \"Sexual Response\" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-date=9 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709191701/http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707224758/http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Koedt70\">{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |access-date = 18 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archive-date = 19 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems===\n{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}\nSexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty.

The arousal disorder is a female sexual dysfunction. Arousal disorder means lack of vaginal lubrication. In addition, blood flow problems may affect arousal disorder. Lack of orgasm, also known as, anorgasmia is another sexual dysfunction in women. The anorgasmia occurs in women with psychological disorders such as guilt and anxiety that was caused by sexual assault. The last sexual disorder is the painful intercourse. The sexual disorder can be result of pelvic mass, scar tissue, sexually transmitted infection and more.<ref>{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|website=webmd.com|access-date=2 December 2015|archive-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913075342/http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are also three common sexual disorders for men including sexual desire, ejaculation disorder, and erectile dysfunction.

This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities.

These groups had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. Hunter-gatherers also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism.\n\nA common tension in hunter-gatherer societies is expressed in their art, which emphasized male sexuality and prowess, but also blurred gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] myth, the gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOnce agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to land ownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged.\n\nWhile retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nBefore the [[High Middle Ages]], homosexual acts appear to have been ignored or tolerated by the Christian church.<ref name=\"psychology.ucdavis.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |title=Homosexuality and Mental Health |publisher=Psychology.ucdavis.edu |access-date=30 June 2013 |archive-date=2 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202132451/https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |url-status=live }}</ref> During the 12th century, hostility toward homosexuality began to spread throughout religious and secular institutions. By the end of the 19th century, it was viewed as a pathology.<ref name=\"psychology.ucdavis.edu\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, many changes in sexual standards occurred. New artificial birth control devices such as the [[condom]] and [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew, and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In Western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; Western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged. There was a new focus on the purpose of marriage; it was increasing regarded as being for love rather than only for economics and reproduction.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Havelock Ellis]] and Sigmund Freud adopted more accepting stances toward homosexuality; Ellis said homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, not a disease, and that many homosexuals made significant contributions to society.<ref name=\"psychology.ucdavis.edu\"/> Freud wrote that all human beings as capable of becoming either heterosexual or homosexual; neither orientation was assumed to be innate.<ref name=\"King, B. 2009\">{{cite book | author = King, Bruce M. | year = 2009 | title = Human Sexuality Today | edition = 6th | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | publisher = [[Vango Books]] | isbn=978-0128645116 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to Freud, a person's orientation depended on the resolution of the Oedipus complex.

He said female homosexuality developed when a girl loved her mother and identified with her father and became fixated at that stage.<ref name=\"King, B. 2009\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAlfred Kinsey initiated the modern era of sex research. He collected data from questionnaires given to his students at [[Indiana University]], but then switched to personal interviews about sexual behaviors. Kinsey and his colleagues sampled 5,300 men and 5,940 women. He found that most people masturbated, that many engaged in oral sex, that women are capable of having multiple orgasms, and that many men had had some type of homosexual experience in their lifetimes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nBefore William Masters, a physician, and Virginia Johnson, a [[behavioral scientist]], the study of anatomy and physiological studies of sex was still limited to experiments with laboratory animals. Masters and Johnson started to directly observe and record the physical responses in humans that are engaged in sexual activity under laboratory settings. They observed 10,000 episodes of sexual acts between 312 men and 382 women. This led to methods of treating clinical problems and abnormalities.

The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.\n\nThough attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and sexual orientation. For example, a gay or lesbian person would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive.{{Cn|date=January 2024}}\n\nIn addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic).

The \"black letter\" approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/> In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/>\n\nIssues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation came to the forefront in Western law in the latter half of the twentieth century, as part of the [[gay liberation]] movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to \"[[come out of the closet]]\" and engage with the legal system, primarily through courts.

The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality (such as female genital mutilation, [[forced marriages]] or lack of access to reproductive health care). Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur.<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nState intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances (e.g. same-sex sexual activity or [[prostitution]]).<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nThe legal systems surrounding prostitution are a topic of debate. Proponents for criminalization argue that sex work is an immoral practice that should not be tolerated, while proponents for decriminalization point out how criminalization does more harm than good. Within the feminist movement, there is also a debate over whether sex work is inherently objectifying and exploitative or whether sex workers have the agency to sell sex as a service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/kate-heartfield-do-prostitutes-sell-themselves-or-a-service-1.877652|title=Kate Heartfield: Do prostitutes sell themselves or a service?|last=Heartfield|first=Kate|website=[[Times Colonist]]|date=7 March 2014 |access-date=30 October 2019|archive-date=30 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030203423/https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/kate-heartfield-do-prostitutes-sell-themselves-or-a-service-1.877652|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen sex work is criminalized, sex workers do not have support from law enforcement when they fall victim to violence.

However, in comparison to other religions, the issue of sexuality in Sikhism is not considered one of paramount importance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sikhism: beliefs about love and sex|url=https://ahcaf.com/sikhism-beliefs-about-love-and-sex/|publisher=GCSE BBC Bitesize|access-date=3 July 2015|archive-date=16 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116145033/https://ahcaf.com/sikhism-beliefs-about-love-and-sex/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human sexuality}}\n{{collist|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Adolescent sexuality]]\n* [[Age of consent]]\n* [[Antisexualism]]\n* [[History of human sexuality]]\n* [[Human female sexuality]]\n* [[Human male sexuality]]\n* [[Human mating strategies]]\n* [[Neuroscience and sexual orientation]]\n* [[Right to sexuality]]\n* [[Sex magic]]\n* [[Sexology]]\n* [[Sexual practices between men]]\n* [[Sexual practices between women]]\n* [[Sexualization]]\n* [[Sex-positive feminism]]\n* [[Sex-positive movement]]\n* [[Sociosexuality]]\n* [[Strategic pluralism]]\n* [[Waist to hip ratio]]\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Durham | first = Meenakshi G. | title = TechnoSex: technologies of the body, mediated corporealities, and the quest for the sexual self | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor | year = 2012 | url = http://clas.uiowa.edu/gwss/news-events/durham-and-waters-freyer-awarded-ahi-grants-2012-13 | author-link1 = Meenakshi Gigi Durham }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Ember |first1=Carol R. |last2=Escobar |first2=Milagro |last3=Rossen |first3=Noah |editor=C.

The vagina is a sheath-like canal that extends from the vulva to the cervix. It receives the penis during intercourse and serves as a depository for sperm. The vagina is also the [[birth canal]]; it can expand to {{convert|10|cm|inch|abbr=on}} during labor and delivery. The vagina is located between the [[bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. The vagina is normally collapsed, but during [[sexual arousal]] it opens, lengthens, and produces lubrication to allow the insertion of the penis.

It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/> The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDuring [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nThe ovaries (female gonads), develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only 400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nOvulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation.\n\nOn day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28\u2014the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle\u2014now called the [[corpus luteum]]\u2014secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Sexual response cycle===\nThe sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina. The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health \"Sexual Response\" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-date=9 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709191701/http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707224758/http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Koedt70\">{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |access-date = 18 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archive-date = 19 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems===\n{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}\nSexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty.

The arousal disorder is a female sexual dysfunction. Arousal disorder means lack of vaginal lubrication. In addition, blood flow problems may affect arousal disorder. Lack of orgasm, also known as, anorgasmia is another sexual dysfunction in women. The anorgasmia occurs in women with psychological disorders such as guilt and anxiety that was caused by sexual assault. The last sexual disorder is the painful intercourse. The sexual disorder can be result of pelvic mass, scar tissue, sexually transmitted infection and more.<ref>{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|website=webmd.com|access-date=2 December 2015|archive-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913075342/http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are also three common sexual disorders for men including sexual desire, ejaculation disorder, and erectile dysfunction.

The vagina is a sheath-like canal that extends from the vulva to the cervix. It receives the penis during intercourse and serves as a depository for sperm. The vagina is also the [[birth canal]]; it can expand to {{convert|10|cm|inch|abbr=on}} during labor and delivery. The vagina is located between the [[bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. The vagina is normally collapsed, but during [[sexual arousal]] it opens, lengthens, and produces lubrication to allow the insertion of the penis. The vagina has three layered walls; it is a self-cleaning organ with natural bacteria that suppress the production of yeast.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The [[G-spot]], named after the [[Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg]] who first reported it in 1950, may be located in the front wall of the vagina and may cause orgasms.

It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/> The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDuring [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nThe ovaries (female gonads), develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only 400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nOvulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation.\n\nOn day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28\u2014the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle\u2014now called the [[corpus luteum]]\u2014secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n"}, {"title": "Brain", "content": "The [[hypothalamus]] is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning.

The vagina is a sheath-like canal that extends from the vulva to the cervix. It receives the penis during intercourse and serves as a depository for sperm. The vagina is also the [[birth canal]]; it can expand to {{convert|10|cm|inch|abbr=on}} during labor and delivery. The vagina is located between the [[bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. The vagina is normally collapsed, but during [[sexual arousal]] it opens, lengthens, and produces lubrication to allow the insertion of the penis. The vagina has three layered walls; it is a self-cleaning organ with natural bacteria that suppress the production of yeast.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The [[G-spot]], named after the [[Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg]] who first reported it in 1950, may be located in the front wall of the vagina and may cause orgasms.

It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/> The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDuring [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nThe ovaries (female gonads), develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only 400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nOvulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation.\n\nOn day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28\u2014the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle\u2014now called the [[corpus luteum]]\u2014secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n"}, {"title": "External female anatomy", "content": "[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|upright|External female genitals (depilated)]]\n\nThe external female genitalia are the [[vulva]].\n\nThe [[mons pubis]] is a soft layer of fatty tissue overlaying the pubic bone.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hyde |last2=DeLamater |last3=Byers|title=Understanding Human Sexuality 5th Canadian ed.|year=2012 |isbn=978-0-07-032972-0|page=78|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson }}</ref> Following puberty, this area grows in size.

It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/> The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDuring [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nThe ovaries (female gonads), develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only 400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nOvulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation.\n\nOn day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28\u2014the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle\u2014now called the [[corpus luteum]]\u2014secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n"}, {"title": "Sexual response cycle", "content": "The sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina. The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health \"Sexual Response\" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-date=9 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709191701/http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707224758/http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Koedt70\">{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |access-date = 18 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archive-date = 19 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n"}, {"title": "Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems", "content": "{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}\nSexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty.

This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities.

The school systems in almost all developed countries have some form of sex education, but the nature of the issues covered varies widely.

These groups had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. Hunter-gatherers also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism.\n\nA common tension in hunter-gatherer societies is expressed in their art, which emphasized male sexuality and prowess, but also blurred gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] myth, the gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOnce agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to land ownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged.\n\nWhile retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nBefore the [[High Middle Ages]], homosexual acts appear to have been ignored or tolerated by the Christian church.<ref name=\"psychology.ucdavis.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |title=Homosexuality and Mental Health |publisher=Psychology.ucdavis.edu |access-date=30 June 2013 |archive-date=2 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202132451/https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |url-status=live }}</ref> During the 12th century, hostility toward homosexuality began to spread throughout religious and secular institutions.

New artificial birth control devices such as the [[condom]] and [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew, and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In Western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; Western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged. There was a new focus on the purpose of marriage; it was increasing regarded as being for love rather than only for economics and reproduction.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Havelock Ellis]] and Sigmund Freud adopted more accepting stances toward homosexuality; Ellis said homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, not a disease, and that many homosexuals made significant contributions to society.<ref name=\"psychology.ucdavis.edu\"/> Freud wrote that all human beings as capable of becoming either heterosexual or homosexual; neither orientation was assumed to be innate.<ref name=\"King, B. 2009\">{{cite book | author = King, Bruce M. | year = 2009 | title = Human Sexuality Today | edition = 6th | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | publisher = [[Vango Books]] | isbn=978-0128645116 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to Freud, a person's orientation depended on the resolution of the Oedipus complex.

These groups had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. Hunter-gatherers also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism.\n\nA common tension in hunter-gatherer societies is expressed in their art, which emphasized male sexuality and prowess, but also blurred gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] myth, the gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOnce agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to land ownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged.\n\nWhile retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality.

Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew, and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In Western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; Western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior.

This may be for companionship, procreation, or an intimate relationship. This involves interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting one or more partners and maintaining sexual interest, can include:\n* [[Flirting]], the use of indirect behavior to convey romantic or sexual interest. It can involve verbal or non-verbal cues, such as sexual comments, [[body language]], gazing, or close to another, but non-verbal flirting is more common.<ref name=\"CECIR\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sufxrS5UFW0C&pg=PA228|title=Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships|isbn=978-1452217109|publisher=Sage Publications|last1=Guerrero|first1=Laura K.|last2=Andersen|first2=Peter A.|last3=Afifi|first3=Walid A.|date=2013|page=228|access-date=14 April 2022|archive-date=30 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220730073846/https://books.google.com/books?id=sufxrS5UFW0C&pg=PA228|url-status=live}}</ref> Flirting is a socially accepted way of attracting someone.

The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.\n\nThough attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and sexual orientation. For example, a gay or lesbian person would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive.{{Cn|date=January 2024}}\n\nIn addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic). [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=R |last2=Perlman |first2=D. |last3=Brehm |first3=S.S. |title=Intimate Relationships |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw Hill Companies}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in [[sex in advertising|advertising]], [[music video]], [[pornography]], [[Sex in film|film]], and other visual media, as well as in [[Model (person)|modeling]], [[sex work]] and other occupations.\n\n===Legal issues===\n\n{{Main|Family law |Divorce |Marriage |Human sexual activity#Legal issues|Sex and the law}}\nGlobally, laws regulate human sexuality in several ways, including criminalizing particular sexual behaviors, granting individuals the privacy or [[autonomy]] to make their own sexual decisions, protecting individuals with regard to equality and non-discrimination, recognizing and protecting other individual rights, as well as legislating matters regarding marriage and the family, and creating laws protecting individuals from violence, harassment, and persecution.<ref name=SexualityLaw1>{{cite web | last1 = Mills | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Haste | first2 = Polly | last3 = Wood | first3 = Stephen | date = 17 June 2016 | title = 1.

The \"black letter\" approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/> In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/>\n\nIssues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation came to the forefront in Western law in the latter half of the twentieth century, as part of the [[gay liberation]] movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to \"[[come out of the closet]]\" and engage with the legal system, primarily through courts. Therefore, many issues regarding human sexuality and the law are found in the opinions of the courts.<ref name=Minnesota1>{{cite web|title=Researching Legal Issues of Sexual Orientation|url=https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|website=library.law.umn.edu|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=3 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012329/https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|archive-date=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Sexual privacy====\n{{See also|Sexual and reproductive health and rights}}\nWhile the issue of privacy has been useful to sexual rights claims, some scholars have criticized its usefulness, saying that this perspective is too narrow and restrictive. The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality (such as female genital mutilation, [[forced marriages]] or lack of access to reproductive health care). Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur.<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nState intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances (e.g. same-sex sexual activity or [[prostitution]]).<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nThe legal systems surrounding prostitution are a topic of debate. Proponents for criminalization argue that sex work is an immoral practice that should not be tolerated, while proponents for decriminalization point out how criminalization does more harm than good. Within the feminist movement, there is also a debate over whether sex work is inherently objectifying and exploitative or whether sex workers have the agency to sell sex as a service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/kate-heartfield-do-prostitutes-sell-themselves-or-a-service-1.877652|title=Kate Heartfield: Do prostitutes sell themselves or a service?|last=Heartfield|first=Kate|website=[[Times Colonist]]|date=7 March 2014 |access-date=30 October 2019|archive-date=30 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030203423/https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/kate-heartfield-do-prostitutes-sell-themselves-or-a-service-1.877652|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen sex work is criminalized, sex workers do not have support from law enforcement when they fall victim to violence. In a 2003 survey of street-based sex workers in NYC, 80% said they had been threatened with or experienced violence, and many said the police were no help. 27% said they had experienced violence from police officers themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sexworkersproject.org/downloads/RevolvingDoor.pdf|title=Revolving Door|last=Thukral|first=Juhu|date=2003|website=Sex Workers Project|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040103043554/http://sexworkersproject.org/downloads/RevolvingDoor.pdf|archive-date=3 January 2004}}</ref> Different identities such as being black, transgender, or poor can result in a person being more likely to be criminally profiled by the police.

The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.\n\nThough attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and sexual orientation. For example, a gay or lesbian person would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive.{{Cn|date=January 2024}}\n\nIn addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic).

Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful including \"promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, pedophilia, predatory sexual behavior, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision\".
