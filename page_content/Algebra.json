It is a generalization of [[arithmetic]] that introduces [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and [[algebraic operation]]s other than the standard arithmetic operations such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]].\n\n[[Elementary algebra]] is the main form of algebra taught in school and examines mathematical statements using variables for unspecified values. It seeks to determine for which values the statements are true. To do so, it utilizes different methods of transforming equations to isolate variables. [[Linear algebra]] is a closely related field investigating variables that appear in several [[linear equation]]s, so-called [[systems of linear equations]]. It tries to discover the values that solve all equations at the same time.\n\n[[Abstract algebra]] studies algebraic structures, which consist of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[mathematical objects]] together with one or several [[binary operations]] defined on that set. It is a generalization of elementary and linear algebra since it allows mathematical objects other than numbers and non-arithmetic operations. It distinguishes between different types of algebraic structures, such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], based on the number of operations they use and the [[Axiom|laws they follow]]. [[Universal algebra]] constitutes a further level of generalization that is not limited to binary operations and investigates more abstract patterns that characterize different classes of algebraic structures.\n\nAlgebraic methods were first studied in the [[ancient period]] to solve specific problems in fields like [[geometry]]. Subsequent mathematicians examined general techniques to solve equations independent of their specific applications. They relied on verbal descriptions of problems and solutions until the 16th and 17th centuries, when a rigorous mathematical formalism was developed. In the mid-19th century, the scope of algebra broadened beyond a [[theory of equations]] to cover diverse types of algebraic operations and algebraic structures. Algebra is relevant to many branches of mathematics, like geometry, [[topology]], [[number theory]], and [[calculus]], and other fields of inquiry, like [[logic]] and the [[empirical sciences]].\n\n== Definition and etymology ==\nAlgebra is the branch of mathematics that studies [[algebraic operations]]{{efn|When understood in the widest sense, an algebraic operation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from a [[Cartesian product#n-ary Cartesian power|Cartesian power of a set into that set]], expressed formally as <math>\\omega: A^n \\to A</math>.

For example, the operation of addition combines two numbers, called the addends, into a third number, called the sum, as in <math>2 + 5 = 7</math>.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n\nElementary algebra relies on the same operations while allowing variables in addition to regular numbers. Variables are [[symbol]]s for unspecified or unknown quantities. They make it possible to state relationships for which one does not know the exact values and to express general laws that are true, independent of which numbers are used. For example, the [[equation]] <math>2 \\times 3 = 3 \\times 2</math> belongs to arithmetic and expresses an equality only for these specific numbers. By replacing the numbers with variables, it is possible to express a general law that applies to any possible combinations of numbers, like the [[Commutative property|principle of commutativity]] expressed in the equation <math>a \\times b = b \\times a</math>.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n[[Algebraic expression]]s are formed by using  arithmetic operations to combine variables and numbers. By convention, the lowercase letters <math>x</math>, <math>y</math> and <math>z</math> represent variables. In some cases, subscripts are added to distinguish variables, as in <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, and <math>x_3</math>. The lowercase letters <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> are usually used for [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]] and [[coefficient]]s.{{efn|Constants represent fixed magnitudes that, unlike variables, cannot change.}} For example, the expression <math>5x + 3</math> is an algebraic expression created by multiplying the number 5 with the variable <math>x</math> and adding the number 3 to the result.

An equation is a statement formed by comparing two expressions with an [[equals sign]] (<math>=</math>), as in <math>5x^2 + 6x = 3y + 4</math>. [[Inequation]]s are formed with symbols like the [[less-than sign]] (<math><</math>), the [[greater-than sign]] (<math>></math>), and the inequality sign (<math>\\neq</math>). Unlike mere expressions, statements can be true or false and their truth value usually depends on the values of the variables. For example, the statement <math>x^2 = 4</math> is true if <math>x</math> is either 2 or &minus;2 and false otherwise.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|pp=129\u2013130}} | {{harvnb|Buthusiem|Toth|2020|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a3QeEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 24\u201328]}} }}</ref> Equations with variables can be divided into identity equations and conditional equations. Identity equations are true for all values that can be assigned to the variables, like the equation <math>2x + 5x = 7x</math>. Conditional equations are only true for some values. For example, the equation <math>x + 4 = 9</math> is only true if <math>x</math> is 5.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Musser|Peterson|Burger|2013|p=16}} | {{harvnb|Goodman|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvY7DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5 5]}} | {{harvnb|Williams|2022}} }}</ref>\n\nThe main objective of elementary algebra is to determine for which values a statement is true. Techniques to transform and manipulate statements are used to achieve this. A key principle guiding this process is that whatever operation is applied to one side of an equation also needs to be done to the other side of the equation. For example, if one subtracts 5 from the left side of an equation one also needs to subtract 5 from the right side of the equation to balance both sides. The goal of these steps is usually to isolate the variable one is interested in on one side, a process known as [[Equation solving|solving the equation]] for that variable. For example, the equation <math>x - 7 = 4</math> can be solved for <math>x</math> by adding 7 to both sides, which isolates <math>x</math> on the left side and results in the equation <math>x = 11</math>.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|p=130}} | {{harvnb|Buthusiem|Toth|2020|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a3QeEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 25\u201328]}} | {{harvnb|Pratt|2022|loc=\u00a7 1.

If two or more equations contradict each other, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no solutions. For example, the equations <math>x_1 - 3x_2 = 0</math> and <math>x_1 - 3x_2 = 7</math> contradict each other since no values of <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math> exist that solve both equations at the same time.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Anton|Rorres|2013|pp=3\u20137}} | {{harvnb|Mortensen|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KYDrCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 73\u201374]}} | {{harvnb|Williams|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HLQ9ocWuCzMC&pg=PA4 4\u20135]}} | {{harvnb|Young|2023|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pMSZEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA714 714\u2013715]}} }}</ref>\n\nWhether a consistent system of equations has a unique solution depends on the number of variables and the number of [[Independent equation|independent equations]]. Several equations are independent of each other if they do not provide the same information and cannot be derived from each other. A unique solution exists if the number of variables is the same as the number of independent equations. [[Underdetermined system]]s, by contrast, have more variables than equations and have an infinite number of solutions if they are consistent.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|p=131}} | {{harvnb|Harrison|Waldron|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_sisAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT464 464]}} | {{harvnb|Anton|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=neYGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA255 255]}} }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Linear Function Graph.svg|thumb|alt=Graph of two linear equations|Linear equations with two variables can be interpreted geometrically as lines.

The substitution method starts with one equation and isolates one variable in it. It proceeds to the next equation and replaces the isolated variable with the found expression, thereby reducing the number of unknown variables by one. It applies the same process again to this and the remaining equations until the values of all variables are determined.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Young|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9HRLAn326zEC&pg=PA697 697\u2013698]}} | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|p=131}} | {{harvnb|Sullivan|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6NKaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA53 53\u201354]}} }}</ref> The elimination method creates a new equation by adding one equation to another equation.

For systems that have two variables, each equation represents a [[Line (geometry)|line]] in [[two-dimensional space]]. The point where the two lines intersect is the solution. For inconsistent systems, the two lines run parallel, meaning that there is no solution since they never intersect. If two equations are not independent then they describe the same line, meaning that every solution of one equation is also a solution of the other equation. These relations make it possible to graphically look for solutions by plotting the equations and determining where they intersect.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Anton|Rorres|2013|pp=3\u20135}} | {{harvnb|Young|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9HRLAn326zEC&pg=PA696 696\u2013697]}} | {{harvnb|Williams|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HLQ9ocWuCzMC&pg=PA4 4\u20135]}} }}</ref> The same principles also apply to systems of equations with more variables, with the difference being that the equations do not describe lines but higher dimensional figures.

Given that both together have twelve apples, students are then asked to find an algebraic equation that describes this situation (<math>2x + x = 12</math>) and to determine how many apples Naomi has (<math>x = 4</math>).<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Arcavi|Drijvers|Stacey|2016|pp=58\u201359}} | {{harvnb|Drijvers|Goddijn|Kindt|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7sVFaMhwackC&pg=PA13 13]}} }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Algebra over a set]]\n* [[Algebra tile]]\n* [[Algebraic combinatorics]]\n* [[C*-algebra]]\n* [[Composition algebra]]\n* [[Computer algebra]]\n* [[Exterior algebra]]\n* [[F-algebra]]\n* [[F-coalgebra]]\n* [[Heyting algebra]]\n* [[Hopf algebra]]\n* [[Non-associative algebra]]\n* [[Outline of algebra]]\n* [[Relational algebra]]\n* [[Sigma-algebra]]\n* [[Symmetric algebra]]\n* [[T-algebra]]\n* [[Tensor algebra]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Abas |first1=Syed Jan |last2=Salman |first2=Amer Shaker |title=Symmetries Of Islamic Geometrical Patterns |date=1994 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-4502-21-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5snsCgAAQBAJ |language=en}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Aleskerov |first1=Fuad |last2=Ersel |first2=Hasan |last3=Piontkovski |first3=Dmitri |title=Linear Algebra for Economists |date=18 August 2011 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-3-642-20570-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipcSD8ZGB8cC&pg=PA1 |language=en}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Andr\u00e9ka |first1=H. |last2=N\u00e9meti |first2=I. |last3=Sain |first3=I. |title=Handbook of Philosophical Logic |date=2001 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |isbn=978-94-017-0452-6 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0452-6_3 |language=en |chapter=Algebraic Logic |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0452-6_3 |access-date=2024-01-24 |archive-date=2024-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240124094523/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0452-6_3 |url-status=live }}\n* {{cite web |last1=Andr\u00e9ka |first1=H. |last2=Madar\u00e1sz |first2=J.

It is a generalization of [[arithmetic]] that introduces [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and [[algebraic operation]]s other than the standard arithmetic operations such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]].\n\n[[Elementary algebra]] is the main form of algebra taught in school and examines mathematical statements using variables for unspecified values. It seeks to determine for which values the statements are true. To do so, it utilizes different methods of transforming equations to isolate variables. [[Linear algebra]] is a closely related field investigating variables that appear in several [[linear equation]]s, so-called [[systems of linear equations]]. It tries to discover the values that solve all equations at the same time.\n\n[[Abstract algebra]] studies algebraic structures, which consist of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[mathematical objects]] together with one or several [[binary operations]] defined on that set. It is a generalization of elementary and linear algebra since it allows mathematical objects other than numbers and non-arithmetic operations. It distinguishes between different types of algebraic structures, such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], based on the number of operations they use and the [[Axiom|laws they follow]]. [[Universal algebra]] constitutes a further level of generalization that is not limited to binary operations and investigates more abstract patterns that characterize different classes of algebraic structures.\n\nAlgebraic methods were first studied in the [[ancient period]] to solve specific problems in fields like [[geometry]]. Subsequent mathematicians examined general techniques to solve equations independent of their specific applications. They relied on verbal descriptions of problems and solutions until the 16th and 17th centuries, when a rigorous mathematical formalism was developed. In the mid-19th century, the scope of algebra broadened beyond a [[theory of equations]] to cover diverse types of algebraic operations and algebraic structures. Algebra is relevant to many branches of mathematics, like geometry, [[topology]], [[number theory]], and [[calculus]], and other fields of inquiry, like [[logic]] and the [[empirical sciences]].\n\n"}, {"title": " Definition and etymology ", "content": "Algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies [[algebraic operations]]{{efn|When understood in the widest sense, an algebraic operation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from a [[Cartesian product#n-ary Cartesian power|Cartesian power of a set into that set]], expressed formally as <math>\\omega: A^n \\to A</math>.

Variables are [[symbol]]s for unspecified or unknown quantities. They make it possible to state relationships for which one does not know the exact values and to express general laws that are true, independent of which numbers are used. For example, the [[equation]] <math>2 \\times 3 = 3 \\times 2</math> belongs to arithmetic and expresses an equality only for these specific numbers. By replacing the numbers with variables, it is possible to express a general law that applies to any possible combinations of numbers, like the [[Commutative property|principle of commutativity]] expressed in the equation <math>a \\times b = b \\times a</math>.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n[[Algebraic expression]]s are formed by using  arithmetic operations to combine variables and numbers. By convention, the lowercase letters <math>x</math>, <math>y</math> and <math>z</math> represent variables. In some cases, subscripts are added to distinguish variables, as in <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, and <math>x_3</math>. The lowercase letters <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> are usually used for [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]] and [[coefficient]]s.{{efn|Constants represent fixed magnitudes that, unlike variables, cannot change.}} For example, the expression <math>5x + 3</math> is an algebraic expression created by multiplying the number 5 with the variable <math>x</math> and adding the number 3 to the result.

An equation is a statement formed by comparing two expressions with an [[equals sign]] (<math>=</math>), as in <math>5x^2 + 6x = 3y + 4</math>. [[Inequation]]s are formed with symbols like the [[less-than sign]] (<math><</math>), the [[greater-than sign]] (<math>></math>), and the inequality sign (<math>\\neq</math>). Unlike mere expressions, statements can be true or false and their truth value usually depends on the values of the variables.

Techniques to transform and manipulate statements are used to achieve this. A key principle guiding this process is that whatever operation is applied to one side of an equation also needs to be done to the other side of the equation. For example, if one subtracts 5 from the left side of an equation one also needs to subtract 5 from the right side of the equation to balance both sides. The goal of these steps is usually to isolate the variable one is interested in on one side, a process known as [[Equation solving|solving the equation]] for that variable. For example, the equation <math>x - 7 = 4</math> can be solved for <math>x</math> by adding 7 to both sides, which isolates <math>x</math> on the left side and results in the equation <math>x = 11</math>.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|p=130}} | {{harvnb|Buthusiem|Toth|2020|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a3QeEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 25\u201328]}} | {{harvnb|Pratt|2022|loc=\u00a7 1.

A system of equations that has solutions is called [[Consistent and inconsistent equations|consistent]]. This is the case if the equations do not contradict each other. If two or more equations contradict each other, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no solutions. For example, the equations <math>x_1 - 3x_2 = 0</math> and <math>x_1 - 3x_2 = 7</math> contradict each other since no values of <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math> exist that solve both equations at the same time.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Anton|Rorres|2013|pp=3\u20137}} | {{harvnb|Mortensen|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KYDrCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 73\u201374]}} | {{harvnb|Williams|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HLQ9ocWuCzMC&pg=PA4 4\u20135]}} | {{harvnb|Young|2023|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pMSZEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA714 714\u2013715]}} }}</ref>\n\nWhether a consistent system of equations has a unique solution depends on the number of variables and the number of [[Independent equation|independent equations]]. Several equations are independent of each other if they do not provide the same information and cannot be derived from each other. A unique solution exists if the number of variables is the same as the number of independent equations. [[Underdetermined system]]s, by contrast, have more variables than equations and have an infinite number of solutions if they are consistent.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|p=131}} | {{harvnb|Harrison|Waldron|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_sisAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT464 464]}} | {{harvnb|Anton|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=neYGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA255 255]}} }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Linear Function Graph.svg|thumb|alt=Graph of two linear equations|Linear equations with two variables can be interpreted geometrically as lines.

The substitution method starts with one equation and isolates one variable in it. It proceeds to the next equation and replaces the isolated variable with the found expression, thereby reducing the number of unknown variables by one. It applies the same process again to this and the remaining equations until the values of all variables are determined.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Young|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9HRLAn326zEC&pg=PA697 697\u2013698]}} | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|p=131}} | {{harvnb|Sullivan|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6NKaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA53 53\u201354]}} }}</ref> The elimination method creates a new equation by adding one equation to another equation.

For systems that have two variables, each equation represents a [[Line (geometry)|line]] in [[two-dimensional space]]. The point where the two lines intersect is the solution. For inconsistent systems, the two lines run parallel, meaning that there is no solution since they never intersect. If two equations are not independent then they describe the same line, meaning that every solution of one equation is also a solution of the other equation. These relations make it possible to graphically look for solutions by plotting the equations and determining where they intersect.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Anton|Rorres|2013|pp=3\u20135}} | {{harvnb|Young|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9HRLAn326zEC&pg=PA696 696\u2013697]}} | {{harvnb|Williams|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HLQ9ocWuCzMC&pg=PA4 4\u20135]}} }}</ref> The same principles also apply to systems of equations with more variables, with the difference being that the equations do not describe lines but higher dimensional figures.

For example, the operation of addition combines two numbers, called the addends, into a third number, called the sum, as in <math>2 + 5 = 7</math>.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n\nElementary algebra relies on the same operations while allowing variables in addition to regular numbers. Variables are [[symbol]]s for unspecified or unknown quantities. They make it possible to state relationships for which one does not know the exact values and to express general laws that are true, independent of which numbers are used. For example, the [[equation]] <math>2 \\times 3 = 3 \\times 2</math> belongs to arithmetic and expresses an equality only for these specific numbers. By replacing the numbers with variables, it is possible to express a general law that applies to any possible combinations of numbers, like the [[Commutative property|principle of commutativity]] expressed in the equation <math>a \\times b = b \\times a</math>.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n[[Algebraic expression]]s are formed by using  arithmetic operations to combine variables and numbers.

For example, if one subtracts 5 from the left side of an equation one also needs to subtract 5 from the right side of the equation to balance both sides. The goal of these steps is usually to isolate the variable one is interested in on one side, a process known as [[Equation solving|solving the equation]] for that variable. For example, the equation <math>x - 7 = 4</math> can be solved for <math>x</math> by adding 7 to both sides, which isolates <math>x</math> on the left side and results in the equation <math>x = 11</math>.<ref>{{multiref | {{harvnb|Maddocks|2008|p=130}} | {{harvnb|Buthusiem|Toth|2020|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a3QeEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 25\u201328]}} | {{harvnb|Pratt|2022|loc=\u00a7 1.
