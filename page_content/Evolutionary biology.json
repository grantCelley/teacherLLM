It is also defined as the study of the history of life forms on Earth. Evolution holds that all species are related and gradually change over generations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is evolution? |url=https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-evolution |date=17 February 2017 |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=YourGenome |language=en}}</ref> In a population, the [[genetic variation]]s affect the [[phenotype]]s (physical characteristics) of an organism. These changes in the phenotypes will be an advantage to some organisms, which will then be passed on to their offspring. Some examples of evolution in species over many generations are the [[peppered moth]] and [[flightless bird]]s. In the 1930s, the discipline of evolutionary biology emerged through what [[Julian Huxley]] called the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of understanding, from previously unrelated fields of biological research, such as [[genetics]] and ecology, [[systematics]], and [[paleontology]].\n\nThe investigational range of current research has widened to encompass the [[genetic architecture]] of [[adaptation]], [[molecular evolution]], and the different forces that contribute to evolution, such as [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], and [[biogeography]]. Moreover, the newer field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (\"evo-devo\") investigates how [[embryogenesis]] is controlled, thus yielding a wider synthesis that integrates [[developmental biology]] with the fields of study covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis.\n\n== Subfields ==\n\n{{see also|Outline of evolution#Subfields|Outline of evolution#Applications in other disciplines}}\n\n[[Evolution]] is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided into various ways. One way is by the level of [[biological organisation|biological organization]], from [[molecular biology|molecular]] to [[cell biology|cell]], organism to [[population biology|population]]. Another way is by perceived [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]], with fields such as [[zoology]], [[botany]], and [[microbiology]], reflecting what was once seen as the major divisions of life. A third way is by approaches, such as field biology, [[theoretical biology]], [[experimental evolution]], and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject have been combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[evolutionary developmental biology]].\n\nMore recently, the merge between biological science and applied sciences gave birth to new fields that are extensions of evolutionary biology, including [[evolutionary robotics]], engineering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ls.toyaku.ac.jp/~lcb-7/en/keywords/evolutionaryengineering.html |website=Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences,  Department of Applied Life Sciences, Lab.

This change increases the chances of survival and reproduction of the organism (this can be referred to as an organism's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]). For example, [[Darwin's finches|Darwin's Finches]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Darwin's finches |url=https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/wildlife/darwins-finches/ |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=Galapagos Conservation Trust |language=en-GB |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211127174718/https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/wildlife/darwins-finches/ |archive-date= 27 November 2021 }}</ref> on Galapagos island developed different shaped beaks in order to survive for a long time. Adaptive evolution can also be convergent evolution if two distantly related species live in similar environments facing similar pressures.\n\n=== Convergent evolution ===\n[[Convergent evolution]] is the process in which related or distantly related organisms evolve similar characteristics independently. This type of evolution creates analogous structures which have a similar function, structure, or form between the two species. For example, sharks and dolphins look alike but they are not related. Likewise, birds, flying insects, and bats all have the ability to fly, but they are not related to each other. These similar traits tend to evolve from having similar environmental pressures.\n\n=== Divergent evolution ===\n[[Divergent evolution]] is the process of speciation. This can happen in several ways:\n\n* [[Allopatric speciation]] is when species are separated by a physical barrier that separates the population into two groups. evolutionary mechanisms such as [[genetic drift]] and [[natural selection]] can then act independently on each population.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.org\">{{Cite web |title=Speciation |url=https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/speciation |access-date=27 November 2022 |website=National Geographic Society }}</ref>\n\n* [[Peripatric speciation]] is a type of allopatric speciation that occurs when one of the new populations is considerably smaller than the other initial population. This leads to the founder's effect and the population can have different allele frequencies and phenotypes than the original population. These small populations are also more likely to see effects from genetic drift.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.org\" />\n\n* [[Parapatric speciation]] is allopatric speciation but occurs when the species diverge without a physical barrier separating the population. This tends to occur when a population of a species is incredibly large and occupies a vast environment.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.org\" />\n\n* [[Sympatric speciation]] is when a new species or subspecies sprouts from the original population while still occupying the same small environment, and without any physical barriers separating them from members of their original population. There is scientific debate as to whether sympatric speciation actually exists.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.org\" />\n\n* Artificial speciation is when scientists purposefully cause new species to emerge to use in laboratory procedures.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.org\" />\n\n=== Coevolution ===\nThe influence of two closely associated species is known as [[coevolution]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=coevolution {{!}} Definition, Examples, & Facts |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/coevolution|access-date=27 November 2021|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> When two or more species evolve in company with each other, one species adapts to changes in other species. This type of evolution often happens in species that have [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]]. For example, predator-prey coevolution, this is the most common type of co-evolution. In this, the predator must evolve to become a more effective hunter because there is a selective pressure on the prey to steer clear of capture. The prey in turn need to develop better survival strategies. The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] is an example of predator-prey interations. The relationship between pollinating insects like bees and flowering plants, herbivores and plants, are also some common examples of diffuse or guild coevolution.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coevolution \u2013 an overview |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/coevolution |access-date=27 November 2022 |website=ScienceDirect Topics }}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism: The process of evolution ==\n\nThe mechanisms of evolution focus mainly on mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, non-random mating, and natural selection.\n\n'''Mutation''': [[Mutation]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is a mutation?|url=https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-a-mutation |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=YourGenome}}</ref> is a change in the [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequence]] inside a gene or a chromosome of an organism. Most mutations are deleterious, or neutral; i.e. they can neither harm nor benefit, but can also be beneficial sometimes.\n\n'''Genetic drift''': [[Genetic drift]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=genetic drift {{!}} Definition, Process, & Effects |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/genetic-drift |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> is a variational process, it happens as a result of the sampling errors from one generation to another generation where a random event that happens by chance in nature changes or influences allele frequency within a population. It has a much stronger effect on small populations than large ones.\n\n'''Gene flow''': [[Gene flow]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=gene flow {{!}} Definition, Effects, & Migration  |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/gene-flow |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> is the transfer of genetic material from the gene pool of one population to another. In a population, migration occurs from one species to another, resulting in the change of allele frequency.\n\n'''Natural selection''': The survival and reproductive rate of a species depends on the adaptability of the species to their environment. This process is called [[natural selection]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=natural selection {{!}} Definition & Processes |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-selection |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Some species with certain traits in a population have higher survival and reproductive rate than others ([[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]), and they pass on these genetic features to their offsprings.\n\n== Evolutionary developmental biology ==\n\n{{Main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}\n\nIn evolutionary developmental biology scientists look at how the different processes in development play a role in how a specific organism reaches its current body plan. The genetic regulation of ontogeny and the phylogenetic process is what allows for this kind of understanding of biology to be possible. By looking at different processes during development, and going through the evolutionary tree, one can determine at which point a specific structure came about. For example, the three germ layers can be observed to not be present in cnidarians and ctenophores, which instead present in worms, being more or less developed depending on the kind of worm itself. Other structures like the development of Hox genes and sensory organs such as eyes can also be traced with this practice.<ref>Ozernyuk, N.D.

They are figures that show how related species are to one another. They formed by analyzing the physical traits as well as the similarities of the DNA between species. Then by using a [[molecular clock]] scientists can estimate when the species diverged. An example of a phylogeny would be the tree of life.\n\n== Homologs ==\nGenes that have shared ancestry are homologs. If a speciation event occurs and one gene ends up in two different species the genes are now orthologous. If a gene is duplicated within the a singular species then it is a paralog. A molecular clock can be used to estimate when these events occurred.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 May 2017 |title=7.13C: Homologs, Orthologs, and Paralogs |url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Book%3A_Microbiology_(Boundless)/7%3A_Microbial_Genetics/7.13%3A_Bioinformatics/7.13C%3A_Homologs%2C_Orthologs%2C_and_Paralogs |access-date=28 November 2022 |website=Biology LibreTexts |language=en}}</ref>[[File:OrthoMaM v10b 2019 116genera circular tree.svg|thumb|Mammalian Phylogeny]]\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of evolutionary thought|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}\n\nThe idea of evolution by natural selection was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1859, but evolutionary biology, as an [[academic discipline]] in its own right, emerged during the period of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smocovitis |first=Vassiliki Betty |year=1996 |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201365 |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |doi=10.1007/BF01947504 |pmid=11623198 |isbn=0-691-03343-9|s2cid=189833728 }}</ref> It was not until the 1980s that many universities had departments of evolutionary biology. In the United States, many universities have created departments of ''molecular and cell biology'' or ''ecology and evolutionary biology'', in place of the older departments of [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. [[Palaeontology]] is often grouped with [[earth science]].\n\n[[Microbiology]] too is becoming an evolutionary discipline now that microbial physiology and [[genomics]] are better understood. The quick [[generation time]] of bacteria and viruses such as [[bacteriophage]]s makes it possible to explore evolutionary questions.\n\nMany biologists have contributed to shaping the modern discipline of evolutionary biology. [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[E. B. Ford]] established an empirical research programme. [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Sewall Wright]], and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] created a sound theoretical framework. [[Ernst Mayr]] in [[systematics]], [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in paleontology and [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] in [[botany]] helped to form the modern synthesis.  [[James F.

This includes fields such as [[paleobiology]], where paleobiologists and evolutionary biologists, including Thomas Halliday and Anjali Goswami, studied the evolution of early mammals going far back in time during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras (between 299 million to 12,000 years ago).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Halliday |first=Thomas |date=29 June 2016 |title=Eutherians experienced elevated evolutionary rates in the immediate aftermath of the Cretaceous\u2013Palaeogene mass extinction |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=283 |issue=1833 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.3026 |pmid=27358361 |pmc=4936024 |s2cid=4920075 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Halliday |first=Thomas |date=28 March 2016 |title=Eutherian morphological disparity across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=152\u2013168 |doi=10.1111/bij.12731 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Other fields related to generic exploration of evolution (\"what happened and when?\" ) include [[systematics]] and [[phylogenetics]].\n\nThird, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the [[genetic architecture]] of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as [[adaptation]] and speciation. They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, how interdependent are the effects of different genes, what do the genes do, and what changes happen to them (e.g., [[point mutations]] vs. [[gene duplication]] or even [[polyploidy|genome duplication]]). They try to reconcile the high [[heritability]] seen in [[twin studies]] with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using [[genome-wide association studies]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=2009|title=Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases|journal=Nature|volume=461|issue=7265|pages=747\u2013753|doi=10.1038/nature08494|author=Manolio TA|author2=Collins FS|author3=Cox NJ|author4=Goldstein DB|author5=Hindorff LA|author6=Hunter DJ|author7=McCarthy MI|author8=Ramos EM|author9=Cardon LR|author10=Chakravarti A|author11=Cho JH|author12=Guttmacher AE|author13=Kong A|author14=Kruglyak L|author15=Mardis E|author16=Rotimi CN|author17=Slatkin M|author18=Valle D|author19=Whittemore AS|author20=Boehnke M|author21=Clark AG|author22=Eichler EE|author23=Gibson G|author24=Haines JL|author25=Mackay TFC|author26=McCarroll SA|author27=Visscher PM|pmid=19812666|pmc=2831613|bibcode=2009Natur.461..747M}}</ref>\n\nOne challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical [[population genetics]] that catalysed the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] must be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge.

Evolutionary forces include [[natural selection]], [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[genetic hitchhiking|genetic draft]], developmental constraints, mutation bias and [[biogeography]].\n\nThis evolutionary approach is key to much current research in organismal biology and ecology, such as [[life history theory]]. [[Gene finding|Annotation of genes]] and their function relies heavily on comparative approaches. The field of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\")]] investigates how developmental processes work, and compares them in different organisms to determine how they evolved.\n\nMany physicians do not have enough background in evolutionary biology, making it difficult to use it in modern medicine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nesse|first1=Randolph M.|last2=Bergstrom|first2=Carl T.|last3=Ellison|first3=Peter T.|last4=Flier|first4=Jeffrey S.|last5=Gluckman|first5=Peter|last6=Govindaraju|first6=Diddahally R.|last7=Niethammer|first7=Dietrich|last8=Omenn|first8=Gilbert S.|last9=Perlman|first9=Robert L.|last10=Schwartz|first10=Mark D.|last11=Thomas|first11=Mark G.|date=26 January 2010|title=Making evolutionary biology a basic science for medicine|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=107|issue=suppl 1|pages=1800\u20131807|doi=10.1073/pnas.0906224106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19918069|pmc=2868284|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.1800N |doi-access=free}}</ref> However, there are efforts to gain a deeper understanding of disease through [[evolutionary medicine]] and to develop [[Evolutionary therapy|evolutionary therapies]].\n\n== Drug resistance today ==\nEvolution plays a role in resistance of drugs; for example, how HIV becomes resistant to medications and the body's immune system. The mutation of resistance of HIV is due to the natural selection of the survivors and their offspring.

Without the proper medicine, a sickness can be the death of a patient. If their body has resistance to a certain number of drugs, then the right medicine will be harder and harder to find.

It is also defined as the study of the history of life forms on Earth. Evolution holds that all species are related and gradually change over generations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is evolution? |url=https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-evolution |date=17 February 2017 |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=YourGenome |language=en}}</ref> In a population, the [[genetic variation]]s affect the [[phenotype]]s (physical characteristics) of an organism. These changes in the phenotypes will be an advantage to some organisms, which will then be passed on to their offspring. Some examples of evolution in species over many generations are the [[peppered moth]] and [[flightless bird]]s. In the 1930s, the discipline of evolutionary biology emerged through what [[Julian Huxley]] called the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of understanding, from previously unrelated fields of biological research, such as [[genetics]] and ecology, [[systematics]], and [[paleontology]].\n\nThe investigational range of current research has widened to encompass the [[genetic architecture]] of [[adaptation]], [[molecular evolution]], and the different forces that contribute to evolution, such as [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], and [[biogeography]]. Moreover, the newer field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (\"evo-devo\") investigates how [[embryogenesis]] is controlled, thus yielding a wider synthesis that integrates [[developmental biology]] with the fields of study covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis.\n\n"}, {"title": " Subfields ", "content": "\n{{see also|Outline of evolution#Subfields|Outline of evolution#Applications in other disciplines}}\n\n[[Evolution]] is the central unifying concept in biology.

This includes fields such as [[paleobiology]], where paleobiologists and evolutionary biologists, including Thomas Halliday and Anjali Goswami, studied the evolution of early mammals going far back in time during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras (between 299 million to 12,000 years ago).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Halliday |first=Thomas |date=29 June 2016 |title=Eutherians experienced elevated evolutionary rates in the immediate aftermath of the Cretaceous\u2013Palaeogene mass extinction |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=283 |issue=1833 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.3026 |pmid=27358361 |pmc=4936024 |s2cid=4920075 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Halliday |first=Thomas |date=28 March 2016 |title=Eutherian morphological disparity across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=152\u2013168 |doi=10.1111/bij.12731 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Other fields related to generic exploration of evolution (\"what happened and when?\" ) include [[systematics]] and [[phylogenetics]].\n\nThird, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the [[genetic architecture]] of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as [[adaptation]] and speciation. They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, how interdependent are the effects of different genes, what do the genes do, and what changes happen to them (e.g., [[point mutations]] vs. [[gene duplication]] or even [[polyploidy|genome duplication]]). They try to reconcile the high [[heritability]] seen in [[twin studies]] with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using [[genome-wide association studies]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=2009|title=Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases|journal=Nature|volume=461|issue=7265|pages=747\u2013753|doi=10.1038/nature08494|author=Manolio TA|author2=Collins FS|author3=Cox NJ|author4=Goldstein DB|author5=Hindorff LA|author6=Hunter DJ|author7=McCarthy MI|author8=Ramos EM|author9=Cardon LR|author10=Chakravarti A|author11=Cho JH|author12=Guttmacher AE|author13=Kong A|author14=Kruglyak L|author15=Mardis E|author16=Rotimi CN|author17=Slatkin M|author18=Valle D|author19=Whittemore AS|author20=Boehnke M|author21=Clark AG|author22=Eichler EE|author23=Gibson G|author24=Haines JL|author25=Mackay TFC|author26=McCarroll SA|author27=Visscher PM|pmid=19812666|pmc=2831613|bibcode=2009Natur.461..747M}}</ref>\n\nOne challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical [[population genetics]] that catalysed the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] must be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge. This requires a great deal of mathematical development to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of [[molecular evolution]]. For example, biologists try to infer which genes have been under strong selection by detecting [[selective sweeps]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=2002 |title=Detecting recent positive selection in the human genome from haplotype structure |journal=Nature |volume=419 |pages=832\u2013837 |doi=10.1038/nature01140 |issue=6909 |pmid=12397357 |author=Sabeti PC |author2=Reich DE |author3=Higgins JM |author4=Levine HZP |author5=Richter DJ |author6=Schaffner SF |author7=Gabriel SB |author8=Platko JV |author9=Patterson NJ |author10=McDonald GJ |author11=Ackerman HC |author12=Campbell SJ |author13=Altshuler D |author14=Cooper R |author15=Kwiatkowski D |author16=Ward R |author17=Lander ES |bibcode=2002Natur.419..832S |s2cid=4404534  }}</ref>\n\nFourth, the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance.<ref>{{cite book |date=1988| title=Evolutionary progress |chapter= Progress in evolution and meaning in life | pages=49\u201379 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |author=Provine WB}}</ref> Current research seeks to determine this. Evolutionary forces include [[natural selection]], [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[genetic hitchhiking|genetic draft]], developmental constraints, mutation bias and [[biogeography]].\n\nThis evolutionary approach is key to much current research in organismal biology and ecology, such as [[life history theory]]. [[Gene finding|Annotation of genes]] and their function relies heavily on comparative approaches. The field of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\")]] investigates how developmental processes work, and compares them in different organisms to determine how they evolved.\n\nMany physicians do not have enough background in evolutionary biology, making it difficult to use it in modern medicine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nesse|first1=Randolph M.|last2=Bergstrom|first2=Carl T.|last3=Ellison|first3=Peter T.|last4=Flier|first4=Jeffrey S.|last5=Gluckman|first5=Peter|last6=Govindaraju|first6=Diddahally R.|last7=Niethammer|first7=Dietrich|last8=Omenn|first8=Gilbert S.|last9=Perlman|first9=Robert L.|last10=Schwartz|first10=Mark D.|last11=Thomas|first11=Mark G.|date=26 January 2010|title=Making evolutionary biology a basic science for medicine|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=107|issue=suppl 1|pages=1800\u20131807|doi=10.1073/pnas.0906224106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19918069|pmc=2868284|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.1800N |doi-access=free}}</ref> However, there are efforts to gain a deeper understanding of disease through [[evolutionary medicine]] and to develop [[Evolutionary therapy|evolutionary therapies]].\n\n"}, {"title": " Drug resistance today ", "content": "Evolution plays a role in resistance of drugs; for example, how HIV becomes resistant to medications and the body's immune system.
