The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \"abnormal\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical [[Mind\u2013body dualism|dualism]] in regard to the [[mind\u2013body problem]]. There have also been different approaches in trying to [[Classification of mental disorders|classify mental disorders]]. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are [[wikt:subnormal|subnormal]], [[wikt:supernormal|supernormal]] and [[wikt:paranormal|paranormal]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0074965 |title=What is abnormal psychology? |year=1930 | vauthors = Bridges JW |journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=430\u20132}}</ref>\n\nThe science of abnormal psychology studies two types of behaviors: adaptive and [[maladaptive behavior]]s. Behaviors that are maladaptive suggest that some problem(s) exist, and can also imply that the individual is vulnerable and cannot cope with environmental stress, which is leading them to have problems functioning in daily life in their emotions, mental thinking, physical actions and talks. Behaviors that are adaptive are ones that are well-suited to the nature of people, their lifestyles and surroundings, and to the people that they communicate with, allowing them to understand each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology|publisher=Prentice Hall |location=US| vauthors =Sarason IG, Sarason BR |edition=6th }}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Clinical psychology]] is the applied field of psychology that seeks to assess, understand, and treat psychological conditions in clinical practice. The theoretical field known as ''abnormal psychology'' may form a backdrop to such work, but clinical psychologists in the current field are unlikely to use the term ''abnormal'' in reference to their practice. [[Psychopathology]] is a similar term to abnormal psychology, but may have more of an implication of an underlying [[pathology]] (disease process), which assumes the medical model of mental disturbance and as such, is a term more commonly used in the medical specialty known as [[psychiatry]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanghellini G | title = Psychopathology: re-humanizing psychiatry | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 127 | issue = 6 | pages = 436\u20137 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23663272 | doi = 10.1111/acps.12091 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of mental disorders}}\n\n=== Humors ===\n{{Main articles|Humorism|Four temperaments}}\n[[Hippocrates]] (460\u2013377 BCE) hypothesized that the body and mind become unwell when the so-called [[Humorism|humors]], vital fluids in the body, become unbalanced.

Each humor was associated with a particular temperament: too much phlegm causes a person to be fatigued, too much black bile causes [[melancholia]], yellow bile causes a quick temper, and too much blood causes optimism, cheerfulness, and confidence.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Nevid J, Rathus S, Greene B |title=Abnormal Psychology in a changing world |publisher=Pearson |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-134-44758-2 |location=New York, NY |page=11}}</ref>\n\n===Asylums===\nThe act of placing individuals with mental illness in a separate facility known as an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] dates to 1547, when [[Henry VIII|King Henry VIII of England]] established the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|St. Mary of Bethlehem asylum]] in London. This hospital, nicknamed Bedlam, was famous for its deplorable conditions.<ref name = \"Nolen-Hoeksema_2013\">{{cite book | vauthors = Nolen-Hoeksema S | date = 2013 | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | location = Boston | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 978-0078035388 }}</ref> Asylums remained popular throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance|Renaissance era]]. These early asylums often had miserable conditions. Patients were seen as a \"burden\" to society, locked away and treated almost like beasts to be dealt with, rather than patients needing treatment. However, many of the patients received helpful medical treatment. There was scientific curiosity into abnormal behavior, although it was rarely investigated in the early asylums. Inmates in these early asylums were often put on display for profit, as they were viewed as less than human. The early asylums were basically modifications of the existing criminal institutions.<ref name=\"Fadul_2014\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Theory & Practice in Psychotherapy & Counseling| vauthors = Fadul JA |publisher=Lulu Press Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-312-34920-9|location=Raleigh, NC|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 18th century, the idea of humanitarian treatment for the patients gained much favor, due to the work of [[Philippe Pinel]] in France. He pushed for the idea that the patients should be treated with kindness, and not the cruelty inflicted on them, as if they were animals or criminals. His experimental ideas, such as removing the chains from the patients, were met with reluctance. The experiments in kindness proved to be a great success, which helped to bring about a reform in the way mental institutions would be run.<ref name=\"Fadul_2014\" />\n\nInstitutionalization would continue to improve throughout the 19th and 20th century, as a result of the work of many humanitarians such as [[Dorothea Dix]], and the [[Social hygiene movement|mental hygiene movement]] which promoted the physical well-being of the mental patients. \"Dix, more than any other figure in the nineteenth century, made people in America and virtually all of Europe aware that the insane were being subjected to incredible abuses.\"<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rimm DC, Somervill JW | title = Abnormal Psychology | location = New York | publisher = Academic Press | date = 1977 | isbn = 978-0-12-588840-0 }} {{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref> Through this movement, millions of dollars were raised to build new institutions to house the mentally ill.

These hospitals, while better than the asylums of the past, were still lacking in the means of effective treatment for the patients. Even though the reform movement had occurred, patients were often still met with cruel and inhumane treatment.\n\nThings began to change in the year 1946, when [[Mary Jane Ward]] published the influential novel titled ''The Snake Pit'', which was made into a [[The Snake Pit|popular movie of the same name]]. The book called attention to the conditions which mental patients faced, and helped to spark concern in the general public to create more humane mental health care in these overcrowded hospitals.<ref name = Osborn/>\n\nThat same year, the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] was also created, which provided support for the training of hospital employees, and research into the conditions of the patients. During this period, the [[Hill\u2013Burton Act|Hill-Burton Acts]] was also passed, which was a program that funded mental health hospitals. Along with the Community Health Services Act of 1963, the Hill-Burton Acts helped with the creation of outpatient psychiatric clinics, inpatient general hospitals, and rehabilitation and community consultation centers.<ref name=\"Fadul_2014\" />\n\n=== Deinstitutionalisation ===\nIn the late twentieth century, however, a large number of mental hospitals were closed in many countries. In England, for example, only 14 of the 130 psychiatric institutions that had been created in the early 20th century remained open at the start of the 21st century.<ref name = Osborn/> In 1963, [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] launched the community health movement in the United States as a \"bold new approach\" to mental health care, aimed at coordinating mental health services for citizens in mental health centers. In the span of 40 years, the United States was able to see an about 90 percent drop in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals.<ref name = \"Nolen-Hoeksema_2013\" />\n\nDeinstitutionalisation ended the long-term confinement of patients in isolating mental hospitals, which could and did cause long-term negative adaptations. For instance, institutionalizing people with schizophrenia worsens [[Schizophrenia#Negative symptoms|negative symptoms]].<ref>[https://karger.com/psp/article-abstract/40/2/83/284622/Lifelong-Course-of-Positive-and-Negative-Symptoms Lifelong Course of Positive and Negative Symptoms],Branislav Mancevski; John Keilp; Matthew Kurzon; Robert M.

Historically, there have been [[Biopsychiatry controversy|three main approaches]] to abnormal behavior: the [[supernatural]], [[biological]], and [[psychological]] traditions.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|7}} Abnormal psychology revolves around two major [[paradigm]]s for explaining mental disorders, the ''psychological'' paradigm and the ''biological'' paradigm. The psychological paradigm focuses more on the humanistic, cognitive, and behavioral causes and effects of psychopathology. The biological paradigm includes theories that focus more on physical factors, such as [[genetics]] and [[neurochemistry]].\n\n===Supernatural explanations===\nIn the first supernatural tradition, also called the demonological method, abnormal behaviors are attributed to agents outside human bodies. According to this model, abnormal behaviors are caused by [[demon]]s, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], or spirits, or the influences of the [[Moon]], planets, and stars. During the Stone Age, [[trepanning]] was performed on those who had [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], to literally cut the evil spirits out of the victim's head. Conversely, [[History of China|Ancient Chinese]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, and [[Hebrews]] believed that these were evil demons or spirits and advocated [[exorcism]]. By the time of the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]], mental illnesses were thought to be caused by an imbalance of the [[four humors]] which lead treatments like the draining of fluids from the [[brain]]. During the [[Medieval]] period, many Europeans believed that the power of [[Witchcraft|witches]], demons, and spirits caused abnormal behaviors. People with psychological disorders were thought to be possessed by evil spirits that had to be exorcised through [[Religion|religious]] rituals. If exorcism failed, some authorities advocated steps such as confinement, beating, and other types of [[torture]] to make the body uninhabitable to witches, demons, and spirits. The belief that witches, demons, and spirits are responsible for the abnormal behavior continued into the 15th century.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|8}} Swiss [[Alchemy|alchemist]], astrologer, and [[physician]] [[Paracelsus]] (1493\u20131541), on the other hand, rejected the idea that abnormal behaviors were caused by [[witches]], demons, and spirits and suggested that people's mind and behaviors were influenced by the movements of the moon and stars.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|11}} This tradition is still alive today. Some people, especially in the developing countries, as well as some followers of religious [[sect]]s in the developed countries, continue to believe that [[supernatural]] powers influence human behaviors. In Western [[academia]], the supernatural tradition has been largely replaced by the biological and psychological traditions.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|26}}\n\n'''Supernatural traditions'''\n\nThroughout time, societies have proposed several explanations of abnormal behavior within human beings. Beginning in some hunter-gatherer societies, [[Animism|animists]] have believed that people demonstrating abnormal behavior are possessed by [[Vengeful ghost|malevolent spirits]]. This idea has been associated with [[Trepanning|trepanation]], the practice of cutting a hole into the individual's skull in order to release the malevolent spirits.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hansell|Damour|2005|pp=Ch 3. pp. 30\u201333}}</ref> Although it has been difficult to define abnormal psychology, one definition includes characteristics such as statistical infrequency.<ref>{{cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology|vauthors=Davison GC|publisher=Veronica Visentin|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-84072-6|location=Toronto|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nA more formalized response to spiritual beliefs about abnormality is the practice of exorcism. Performed by religious authorities, exorcism is thought of as another way to release evil spirits who cause pathological behavior within the person. In some instances, individuals exhibiting unusual thoughts or behaviors have been [[exile]]d from society, or worse. Perceived witchcraft, for example, has been punished by death. Two Catholic Inquisitors wrote the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (Latin for \"The Hammer Against Witches\"), which was used by many Inquisitors and witch-hunters. It contained an early taxonomy of perceived deviant behavior, and proposed guidelines for prosecuting deviant individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Herzig T |date=2010|title=Malleus maleficarum (review) |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/magic_ritual_and_witchcraft/v005/5.1.herzig.html |journal=Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=135\u2013138|doi=10.1353/mrw.0.0161|s2cid=161336612|issn=1940-5111}}</ref>\n\n===Biological explanations===\nIn the biological tradition, psychological disorders are attributed to biological causes. In the psychological tradition, disorders are attributed to faulty [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]], and to [[Social environment|social context]].<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|26}} The medical or biological perspective holds the belief that most or all abnormal behavior can be attributed to a medical factor; assuming all psychological disorders are diseases.<ref name=\"Purgatory Perspectives: Medical\">{{cite web|title=Perspectives: Medical|url=http://www.purgatory.net/merits/medical.htm | work = A Beginner's Guide to Abnormal Psychology }}</ref>\n\nThe Greek physician [[Hippocrates]], who is considered to be the father of Western medicine, played a major role in the biological tradition. Hippocrates and his associates wrote the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] between 450 and 350 BC, in which they suggested that abnormal behaviors can be treated like any other disease. Hippocrates viewed the brain as the seat of [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], and [[wisdom]] and believed that disorders involving these functions would logically be located in the brain.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|11}}\n\nThese ideas of Hippocrates and his associates were later adopted by [[Galen]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician. [[Galen]] extended these ideas and developed a strong and influential school of thought within the biological tradition that extended well into the 18th century.\n\nKendra Cherry, MSEd, states: \"The medical approach to abnormal psychology focuses on the biological causes of mental illness. This perspective emphasizes understanding the underlying cause of disorders, which might include genetic inheritance, related physical disorders, infections, and chemical imbalances. Medical treatments are often pharmacological in nature, although medication is often used in conjunction with some other type of psychotherapy.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.verywell.com/what-is-abnormal-psychology-2794775|title=What Is Abnormal Psychology?| vauthors = Cherry K |date=May 9, 2016|work=Verywell|access-date=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n\n===Psychological explanations===\n\nAccording to Sigmund Freud's [[Id, ego and super-ego|structural model]], the id, ego, and superego are three theoretical constructs that define the way an individual interacts with the external world, as well as responding to internal forces<ref name=\"Boag_2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boag S | title = Ego, drives, and the dynamics of internal objects | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 666 | date = July 1, 2014 | pmid = 25071640 | pmc = 4076885 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00666 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The Id represents the instinctual drives of an individual that remain unconscious. The super-ego represents a person's conscience and their internalization of societal norms and morality. Finally, the ego serves to realistically integrate the drives of the id with the prohibitions of the super-ego. Lack of development in the Superego, or an incoherently developed Superego within an individual, will result in thoughts and actions that are irrational and abnormal, contrary to the norms and beliefs of society.<ref name=\"Boag_2014\" />\n\n====Irrational beliefs====\nIrrational beliefs are driven by unconscious fears and can result in abnormal behavior.<ref name=\"Turner_2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner MJ | title = Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Irrational and Rational Beliefs, and the Mental Health of Athletes | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | pages = 1423 | date = 2016-09-20 | pmid = 27703441 | pmc = 5028385 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01423 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Rational emotive behavior therapy]] helps to drive irrational and maladaptive beliefs out of one's mind.<ref name=\"Turner_2016\" />\n\n==== Sociocultural influences====\nThe term sociocultural refers to the various circles of influence on the individual, ranging from close friends and family, to the institutions and policies of a country, or the world as a whole.

A precipitating cause is an immediate trigger that instigates a person's action or behavior. A predisposing cause is an underlying factor that interacts with the immediate factors to result in a disorder. Both causes play a key role in the development of a psychological disorder.<ref name = \"Hansell_2005_37\" /> For example, high neuroticism antedates most types of psychopathology.<ref name=\"NeuroticismMA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Ormel J | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883\u20132906 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27523506 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291716001653 | s2cid = 23548727 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/895885 }}</ref>\n\n===Recent concepts of abnormality===\n* ''Statistical abnormality''<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gilles-Thomas |first=David L. |date=1989 |title=Definitions of Abnormality |url=https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~dgthomas/Abpsy/lecture1.html |access-date=2022-06-05 |website=[[University of Buffalo]]}}</ref> \u2013 when a certain behavior/characteristic is relevant to a low percentage of the population.

However, the problems associated with a low IQ differ widely across individuals depending on their life circumstances. So, even when an individual is defined as psycho-metrically 'abnormal', this tells us little about their actual condition or problems. Furthermore, if one takes the other end of the IQ spectrum, a deviation of 30 points above the mean is generally not considered to be abnormal, or to indicate the presence of mental health problems.\n* ''Deviant behavior'' \u2013 this is not always a sign of mental illness, as mental illness can occur without deviant behavior, and such behavior may occur in the absence of mental illness.\n* ''Combinations'' \u2013 including distress, dysfunction, distorted psychological processes, inappropriate responses in given situations, and causing/risking harm to oneself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|2003|pp=3\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==== Examples ====\nThere is a wide range of [[mental disorder]]s that are considered to be forms of Abnormal Psychology.

These ideas often represented repressed emotions and memories from a patient's childhood within their unconscious. According to psychoanalytic theory, these repressions cause the disturbances that people experience in their daily lives, and by finding the source of these disturbances, one should be able to eliminate the disturbance itself. This is accomplished by a variety of methods, with some popular ones being [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], [[hypnosis]], and [[insight]]. The goal of these methods is to induce a [[catharsis]], or emotional release in the patient, which should indicate that the source of the problem has been tapped, and it can then be treated. Freud's [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual stages]] also played a key role in this form of therapy, as he would often believe that the problems the patient was experiencing were due to them becoming stuck, or \"[[Fixation (psychology)|fixated]]\", in a particular stage. Dreams also played a major role in this form of therapy, as Freud viewed dreams as a way to gain insight into the unconscious mind. Patients were often asked to keep dream journals to bring in for discussion during the next therapy session.  There are many potential problems associated with this style of therapy, including resistance to the repressed memory or feeling, and [[negative transference]] onto the therapist. Psychoanalysis was carried on by many after Freud, including his daughter [[Anna Freud]], and [[Jacques Lacan]]. Many others have also gone on to elaborate on Freud's original theory, and to add their own take on [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanisms]] or [[Dream interpretation|dream analysis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovacevic F |year= 2013|title=A Lacanian approach to dream interpretation |journal=[[Dreaming (journal)|Dreaming]] |volume=23  |issue=1 |pages=78\u201389 |doi=10.1037/a0032206}}</ref>  While psychoanalysis has fallen out of favor to more modern forms of therapy, it is still used by some clinical psychologists to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smit Y, Huibers MJ, Ioannidis JP, van Dyck R, van Tilburg W, Arntz A | title = The effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy--a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 81\u201392 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22227111 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.11.003 }}</ref>\n\n===Behavioral therapy (Wolpe)===\n[[Behaviour therapy|Behavior therapy]] relies on the principles of [[behaviorism]], such as involving [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]]. Behaviorism arose in the early 20th century, from the work of psychologists such as James Watson and [[B. F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism states that all behaviors humans do is because of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] and [[reinforcement]]. While this reinforcement is normally for good behavior, it can also occur for maladaptive behavior.  In this therapeutic view, the patients maladaptive behavior has been reinforced, which will cause the maladaptive behavior to be repeated. The goal of the therapy is to reinforce less maladaptive behaviors, so that with time, these adaptive behaviors will become the primary ones in the patient.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Edwards J |date=2016|title=Behaviorism and Control in the History of Economics and Psychology|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/hope/article/48/suppl_1/170-197/28071|journal=History of Political Economy|language=en|volume=48|issue=suppl 1|pages=170\u2013197|doi=10.1215/00182702-3619262|issn=0018-2702}}</ref>\n\n===Humanistic therapy (Rogers)===\n\n[[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic therapy]] aims to achieve [[self-actualization]] ([[Carl Rogers]], 1961). In this style of therapy, the therapist will focus on the patient themselves, as opposed to the patient's problem. The goal of this therapy is, by treating the patient as \"human\", rather than \"client\", to get to the source of the problem, and to resolve the problem in an effective manner. Humanistic therapy has been on the rise in recent years, and has been associated with numerous positive benefits. It is considered to be one of the core elements needed for therapeutic effectiveness, and a significant contributor to not only the well-being of the patient, but society as a whole. Some say that all of the therapeutic approaches today draw from the humanistic approach in some regard, and that humanistic therapy is the best way for treat a patient.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider KJ, L\u00e4ngle A | title = The renewal of humanism in psychotherapy: summary and conclusion | journal = Psychotherapy | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 480\u20131 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23205836 | doi = 10.1037/a0028026 }}</ref> Humanistic therapy can be used on people of all ages; it is very popular among children in its variant known as \"[[play therapy]]\".<ref name=\"Lin_2015\" />\n\n===Cognitive behavioural therapy (Ellis and Beck)===\n\n[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT) aims to influence thought and cognition (Beck, 1977). This form of therapy relies on not only the components of behavioral therapy as mentioned before, but also the elements of [[cognitive psychology]].<ref name=\"Phares_2014\" />{{rp|101\u2013102}} This relies on not only the clients behavioral problems that could have arisen from conditioning, but also their [[Schema (psychology)|negative schemas]] and [[Beck's cognitive triad|distorted perceptions]] of the world around them.  These negative schemas may cause distress in the life of the patient; for example, the schemas may give them unrealistic expectations for how well they should perform at their job, or how they should look physically. When these expectations are not met, it will often result in maladaptive behaviors, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsions]], and [[anxiety]]. With CBT, the goal is to change the schemas that are causing the stress in the patients life, and replace them with more realistic ones. Once the negative schemas have been replaced, it will hopefully cause a remission of the patients symptoms. CBT is considered particularly effective in the treatment of depression, and has even been used in recent years in group settings. It is felt that using CBT in a group setting aids in giving its members a sense of support, and decreasing the likelihood of them dropping out of therapy before the treatment has had time to work properly.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hans E, Hiller W | title = Effectiveness of and dropout from outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for adult unipolar depression: a meta-analysis of nonrandomized effectiveness studies | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 75\u201388 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23379264 | doi = 10.1037/a0031080 }}</ref> CBT has been found to be an effective treatment for many patients, even those who do not have diseases and disorders typically thought of as psychiatric ones.

In [[play therapy]], the clinicians will \"play\" with their client, usually with toys, or a tea party. Playing is the typical behavior of a child, and therefore, playing with the therapist will come as a natural response to the child. In playing together, the clinician will ask the patient questions, and due to the setting, the questions seem less intrusive, more therapeutic, and more like a normal conversation. This should help the patient realize issues they have, and confess them to the therapist with less difficulty than they may experience in a traditional counselling setting.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Bratton SC, Ceballos PL, Sheely-Moore AI, Meany-Walen K, Pronchenko Y, Jones LD |year=2013|title=Head start early mental health intervention: Effects of child-centered play therapy on disruptive behaviors|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|volume=22|pages=28\u201342|doi=10.1037/a0030318}}</ref>\n\nPlay therapy involves a therapist observing a child as the child plays with toys and interacts with their surrounding environment.

Behaviors that are adaptive are ones that are well-suited to the nature of people, their lifestyles and surroundings, and to the people that they communicate with, allowing them to understand each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology|publisher=Prentice Hall |location=US| vauthors =Sarason IG, Sarason BR |edition=6th }}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Clinical psychology]] is the applied field of psychology that seeks to assess, understand, and treat psychological conditions in clinical practice.

Historically, there have been [[Biopsychiatry controversy|three main approaches]] to abnormal behavior: the [[supernatural]], [[biological]], and [[psychological]] traditions.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|7}} Abnormal psychology revolves around two major [[paradigm]]s for explaining mental disorders, the ''psychological'' paradigm and the ''biological'' paradigm. The psychological paradigm focuses more on the humanistic, cognitive, and behavioral causes and effects of psychopathology. The biological paradigm includes theories that focus more on physical factors, such as [[genetics]] and [[neurochemistry]].\n\n===Supernatural explanations===\nIn the first supernatural tradition, also called the demonological method, abnormal behaviors are attributed to agents outside human bodies. According to this model, abnormal behaviors are caused by [[demon]]s, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], or spirits, or the influences of the [[Moon]], planets, and stars. During the Stone Age, [[trepanning]] was performed on those who had [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], to literally cut the evil spirits out of the victim's head. Conversely, [[History of China|Ancient Chinese]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, and [[Hebrews]] believed that these were evil demons or spirits and advocated [[exorcism]]. By the time of the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]], mental illnesses were thought to be caused by an imbalance of the [[four humors]] which lead treatments like the draining of fluids from the [[brain]]. During the [[Medieval]] period, many Europeans believed that the power of [[Witchcraft|witches]], demons, and spirits caused abnormal behaviors. People with psychological disorders were thought to be possessed by evil spirits that had to be exorcised through [[Religion|religious]] rituals. If exorcism failed, some authorities advocated steps such as confinement, beating, and other types of [[torture]] to make the body uninhabitable to witches, demons, and spirits. The belief that witches, demons, and spirits are responsible for the abnormal behavior continued into the 15th century.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|8}} Swiss [[Alchemy|alchemist]], astrologer, and [[physician]] [[Paracelsus]] (1493\u20131541), on the other hand, rejected the idea that abnormal behaviors were caused by [[witches]], demons, and spirits and suggested that people's mind and behaviors were influenced by the movements of the moon and stars.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|11}} This tradition is still alive today. Some people, especially in the developing countries, as well as some followers of religious [[sect]]s in the developed countries, continue to believe that [[supernatural]] powers influence human behaviors. In Western [[academia]], the supernatural tradition has been largely replaced by the biological and psychological traditions.<ref name = \"Barlow_2012\" />{{rp|26}}\n\n'''Supernatural traditions'''\n\nThroughout time, societies have proposed several explanations of abnormal behavior within human beings. Beginning in some hunter-gatherer societies, [[Animism|animists]] have believed that people demonstrating abnormal behavior are possessed by [[Vengeful ghost|malevolent spirits]]. This idea has been associated with [[Trepanning|trepanation]], the practice of cutting a hole into the individual's skull in order to release the malevolent spirits.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hansell|Damour|2005|pp=Ch 3. pp. 30\u201333}}</ref> Although it has been difficult to define abnormal psychology, one definition includes characteristics such as statistical infrequency.<ref>{{cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology|vauthors=Davison GC|publisher=Veronica Visentin|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-84072-6|location=Toronto|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nA more formalized response to spiritual beliefs about abnormality is the practice of exorcism. Performed by religious authorities, exorcism is thought of as another way to release evil spirits who cause pathological behavior within the person. In some instances, individuals exhibiting unusual thoughts or behaviors have been [[exile]]d from society, or worse. Perceived witchcraft, for example, has been punished by death.

According to this model, abnormal behaviors are caused by [[demon]]s, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], or spirits, or the influences of the [[Moon]], planets, and stars. During the Stone Age, [[trepanning]] was performed on those who had [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], to literally cut the evil spirits out of the victim's head. Conversely, [[History of China|Ancient Chinese]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, and [[Hebrews]] believed that these were evil demons or spirits and advocated [[exorcism]]. By the time of the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]], mental illnesses were thought to be caused by an imbalance of the [[four humors]] which lead treatments like the draining of fluids from the [[brain]]. During the [[Medieval]] period, many Europeans believed that the power of [[Witchcraft|witches]], demons, and spirits caused abnormal behaviors. People with psychological disorders were thought to be possessed by evil spirits that had to be exorcised through [[Religion|religious]] rituals. If exorcism failed, some authorities advocated steps such as confinement, beating, and other types of [[torture]] to make the body uninhabitable to witches, demons, and spirits.

Beginning in some hunter-gatherer societies, [[Animism|animists]] have believed that people demonstrating abnormal behavior are possessed by [[Vengeful ghost|malevolent spirits]].

This is accomplished by a variety of methods, with some popular ones being [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], [[hypnosis]], and [[insight]]. The goal of these methods is to induce a [[catharsis]], or emotional release in the patient, which should indicate that the source of the problem has been tapped, and it can then be treated. Freud's [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual stages]] also played a key role in this form of therapy, as he would often believe that the problems the patient was experiencing were due to them becoming stuck, or \"[[Fixation (psychology)|fixated]]\", in a particular stage. Dreams also played a major role in this form of therapy, as Freud viewed dreams as a way to gain insight into the unconscious mind.

Behaviorism arose in the early 20th century, from the work of psychologists such as James Watson and [[B. F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism states that all behaviors humans do is because of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] and [[reinforcement]]. While this reinforcement is normally for good behavior, it can also occur for maladaptive behavior.  In this therapeutic view, the patients maladaptive behavior has been reinforced, which will cause the maladaptive behavior to be repeated.

In this style of therapy, the therapist will focus on the patient themselves, as opposed to the patient's problem. The goal of this therapy is, by treating the patient as \"human\", rather than \"client\", to get to the source of the problem, and to resolve the problem in an effective manner. Humanistic therapy has been on the rise in recent years, and has been associated with numerous positive benefits. It is considered to be one of the core elements needed for therapeutic effectiveness, and a significant contributor to not only the well-being of the patient, but society as a whole. Some say that all of the therapeutic approaches today draw from the humanistic approach in some regard, and that humanistic therapy is the best way for treat a patient.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider KJ, L\u00e4ngle A | title = The renewal of humanism in psychotherapy: summary and conclusion | journal = Psychotherapy | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 480\u20131 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23205836 | doi = 10.1037/a0028026 }}</ref> Humanistic therapy can be used on people of all ages; it is very popular among children in its variant known as \"[[play therapy]]\".<ref name=\"Lin_2015\" />\n\n===Cognitive behavioural therapy (Ellis and Beck)===\n\n[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT) aims to influence thought and cognition (Beck, 1977).

These negative schemas may cause distress in the life of the patient; for example, the schemas may give them unrealistic expectations for how well they should perform at their job, or how they should look physically. When these expectations are not met, it will often result in maladaptive behaviors, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsions]], and [[anxiety]]. With CBT, the goal is to change the schemas that are causing the stress in the patients life, and replace them with more realistic ones. Once the negative schemas have been replaced, it will hopefully cause a remission of the patients symptoms. CBT is considered particularly effective in the treatment of depression, and has even been used in recent years in group settings. It is felt that using CBT in a group setting aids in giving its members a sense of support, and decreasing the likelihood of them dropping out of therapy before the treatment has had time to work properly.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hans E, Hiller W | title = Effectiveness of and dropout from outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for adult unipolar depression: a meta-analysis of nonrandomized effectiveness studies | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 75\u201388 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23379264 | doi = 10.1037/a0031080 }}</ref> CBT has been found to be an effective treatment for many patients, even those who do not have diseases and disorders typically thought of as psychiatric ones.

In [[play therapy]], the clinicians will \"play\" with their client, usually with toys, or a tea party. Playing is the typical behavior of a child, and therefore, playing with the therapist will come as a natural response to the child. In playing together, the clinician will ask the patient questions, and due to the setting, the questions seem less intrusive, more therapeutic, and more like a normal conversation. This should help the patient realize issues they have, and confess them to the therapist with less difficulty than they may experience in a traditional counselling setting.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Bratton SC, Ceballos PL, Sheely-Moore AI, Meany-Walen K, Pronchenko Y, Jones LD |year=2013|title=Head start early mental health intervention: Effects of child-centered play therapy on disruptive behaviors|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|volume=22|pages=28\u201342|doi=10.1037/a0030318}}</ref>\n\nPlay therapy involves a therapist observing a child as the child plays with toys and interacts with their surrounding environment.

Behaviorism states that all behaviors humans do is because of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] and [[reinforcement]]. While this reinforcement is normally for good behavior, it can also occur for maladaptive behavior.  In this therapeutic view, the patients maladaptive behavior has been reinforced, which will cause the maladaptive behavior to be repeated.

The goal of this therapy is, by treating the patient as \"human\", rather than \"client\", to get to the source of the problem, and to resolve the problem in an effective manner. Humanistic therapy has been on the rise in recent years, and has been associated with numerous positive benefits. It is considered to be one of the core elements needed for therapeutic effectiveness, and a significant contributor to not only the well-being of the patient, but society as a whole.

These negative schemas may cause distress in the life of the patient; for example, the schemas may give them unrealistic expectations for how well they should perform at their job, or how they should look physically. When these expectations are not met, it will often result in maladaptive behaviors, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsions]], and [[anxiety]]. With CBT, the goal is to change the schemas that are causing the stress in the patients life, and replace them with more realistic ones. Once the negative schemas have been replaced, it will hopefully cause a remission of the patients symptoms. CBT is considered particularly effective in the treatment of depression, and has even been used in recent years in group settings. It is felt that using CBT in a group setting aids in giving its members a sense of support, and decreasing the likelihood of them dropping out of therapy before the treatment has had time to work properly.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hans E, Hiller W | title = Effectiveness of and dropout from outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for adult unipolar depression: a meta-analysis of nonrandomized effectiveness studies | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 75\u201388 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23379264 | doi = 10.1037/a0031080 }}</ref> CBT has been found to be an effective treatment for many patients, even those who do not have diseases and disorders typically thought of as psychiatric ones.
