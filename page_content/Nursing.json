The profession combines physical science, social science, nursing theory, and technology in caring for individuals and communities.\n\nTo work in the nursing profession, all nurses hold one or more credentials depending on their [[scope of practice]] and [[nurse education|education]]. In the United States, a [[Licensed Practical Nurse]] (LPN) works independently or with a [[Registered Nurse]] (RN). The most significant difference between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. RNs provide scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. RNs may earn additional [[Nursing credentials and certifications|credentials]] or [[academic degree|degrees]].\n\nIn the United States, multiple educational paths will qualify a candidate to sit for the licensure examination as an RN. An [[Associate of Science in Nursing|Associate Degree in Nursing]] (ADN) is awarded to those who have completed a two-year undergraduate academic degree awarded by community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, and bachelor's degree-granting colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study usually lasting two years.

In providing nursing care, the nurse uses both nursing theory and best practice derived from [[nursing research]].<ref name=Weber2014>{{cite book | last = Weber | first = Janet | title = Nurses' handbook of health assessment | publisher = Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Health | location = Philadelphia | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781451142822 }}</ref> The nursing process is made up of five steps: 1.evaluate, 2. implement, 3. plan, 4. diagnose, and 5. assess. Nurses are able to use this process from the American Nurses Association to determine the best care they can provide for the patient. There are many other diverse nursing theories as well.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |title=Nursing {{!}} The SAGE Encyclopedia of Economics and Society - Credo Reference |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageeas/nursing/0 |access-date=2022-02-18 |website=search.credoreference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn general terms, the nursing process is the method used to [[Nursing assessment|assess]] and [[Nursing diagnosis|diagnose]] needs, plan outcomes and interventions, implement interventions, and evaluate the outcomes of the care provided. Like other disciplines, the profession has developed different theories derived from sometimes diverse philosophical beliefs and [[paradigm]]s or [[worldview]]s to help nurses direct their activities to accomplish specific goals.\n\n==Scope of activities==\n\n===Activities of daily living assistance===\n{{main article|Activities of daily living}} Nurses manage and coordinate care to support activities of daily living (ADL). Often the provision of such care is delegated to [[nursing assistant]]s. This includes assisting in patient mobility, such as moving an activity intolerant patient within bed.\n\n===Medication===\nMedication management and administration are a part of most hospital nursing roles, however, prescribing authority varies between jurisdictions. In many areas, registered nurses administer and manage medications prescribed by a professional with full prescribing authority such as a [[nurse practitioner]] or a [[physician]]. As nurses are responsible for evaluating patients throughout their care - including before and after medication administration - adjustments to medications are often made through a collaborative effort between the prescriber and the nurse. Regardless of the prescriber, nurses are legally responsible for the drugs they administer. There may be legal implications when there is an error in a prescription, and the nurse could be expected to have noted and reported the error. In the United States, nurses have the right to refuse any medication administration that they deem to be potentially harmful to the patient.<ref>Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P.

In a recent review of the empirical human factors and ergonomic literature specific to nursing performance, nurses were found to work in generally poor environmental conditions. Some countries and states have passed legislation regarding acceptable nurse-to-patient ratios.\n\nThe fast-paced and unpredictable nature of health care places nurses at risk for injuries and illnesses, including high [[occupational stress]]. Nursing is a particularly stressful profession, and nurses consistently identify stress as a major work-related concern and have among the highest levels of occupational stress when compared to other professions. This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including new technology that must be mastered, the emotional labor involved in nursing, physical labor, [[shift work]], and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including [[sleep disorders]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[Death|mortality]], psychiatric disorders, stress-related illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing [[compassion fatigue]] and moral [[distress (medicine)|distress]], which can worsen mental health.

They can be individual-focused or organization-focused. Individual-focused interventions include [[stress management]] programs, which can be customized to individuals. Stress management programs can reduce anxiety, sleep disorders, and other symptoms of stress. Organizational interventions focus on reducing stressful aspects of the work environment by defining stressful characteristics and developing solutions to them.

Each state has its own laws, rules, and regulations governing nursing care. Usually the making of such rules and regulations is delegated to a state [[board of nursing]], which performs day-to-day administration of these rules, licenses for nurses and nursing assistants, and makes decisions on nursing issues. In some states, the terms \"nurse\" or \"nursing\" may only be used in conjunction with the practice of a [[registered nurse]] (RN) or [[Licensed Practical Nurse|licensed practical or vocational nurse]] (LPN/LVN).\n\nIn the hospital setting, registered nurses often delegate tasks to LPNs and [[unlicensed assistive personnel]].\n\nRNs are not limited to employment as bedside nurses. They are employed by physicians, attorneys, insurance companies, governmental agencies, community/public health agencies, private industry, school districts, ambulatory surgery centers, among others. Some registered nurses are independent consultants who [[self-employed|work for themselves]], while others work for large manufacturers or chemical companies. Research nurses conduct or assist in the conduct of research or evaluation (outcome and process) in many areas such as biology, psychology, human development, and health care systems.\n\nMany employers offer flexible work schedules, child care, educational benefits, and bonuses. About 21 percent of registered nurses are union members or covered by union contract.<ref name=\"United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics\">United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics</ref>\n\nNursing is the nation's largest health care profession. In 2017, there were more than 4,015,250 registered nurses and 922,196 licensed practical nurses nationwide.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The U.S. Nursing Workforce in 2018 and Beyond |journal=Journal of Nursing Regulation |volume=8 |number=4 |year=2018 |pages=S3\u2013S6 |url=https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2019/10-20190613EnvironmentalScan2018.pdf}}</ref> Of all licensed RNs, 2.6&nbsp;million or 84.8% are employed in nursing. Nurses comprise the largest single component of hospital staff, are the primary providers of hospital patient care, and deliver most of the nation's long-term care. The primary pathway to professional nursing, as compared to technical-level practice, is the four-year Bachelor of Science in nursing (BSN) degree. Registered nurses are prepared either through a BSN program; a three-year associate degree in nursing; or a three-year hospital training program, receiving a hospital diploma. All take the same state licensing exam. (The number of diploma programs has declined steadily\u2014to less than 10 percent of all basic RN education programs\u2014as nursing education has shifted from hospital-operated instruction into the college and university system.)\n\n=====Educational and licensure requirements=====\n\n======Diploma in Nursing======\n{{main article|Diploma in Nursing}}\nThe oldest method of nursing education is the hospital-based diploma program, which lasts approximately three years. Students take between 30 and 60 credit hours in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[nutrition]], [[chemistry]], and other subjects at a college or university, then move on to intensive nursing classes. Until 1996, most RNs in the US were initially educated in nursing by diploma programs.<ref name=\"ANA\">American Nurses Association. [http://www.ana.org/readroom/fsdemogr2.htm#education \"Nursing Facts: Today's Registered Nurse \u2013 Numbers and Demographics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809113102/http://www.ana.org/readroom/fsdemogr2.htm#education |date=9 August 2007 }} Washington, D.C., American Nurses Association, 2006.</ref> According to the Health Services Resources Administration's 2000 Survey of Nurses only six percent of nurses who graduated from nursing programs in the United States received their education at a Diploma School of Nursing.<ref name=\"HRSA\">Health Resources and Service Administration. \"Findings from the National Sample Survey Of Registered Nurses\" Washington, D.C., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Service Administration Bureau of Health Professions Division of Nursing, 2000.</ref>\n\n======Associate Degree in Nursing======\n{{main article|Associate of Science in Nursing}}\nThe most common initial nursing education is a two-year [[Associate Degree in Nursing]] (Associate of Applied Science in Nursing, Associate of Science in nursing, Associate Degree in Nursing), a [[community college|two-year college]] degree referred to as an ADN. Some four-year colleges and universities also offer the ADN. Associate degree nursing programs have prerequisite and corequisite courses (which may include English, Math and Human Anatomy and Physiology) and ultimately stretch out the degree-acquiring process to about three years or greater.\n\n======Bachelor of Science in Nursing======\n{{main article|Bachelor of Science in Nursing}}\nAnother pathway into the profession, or a higher level of education for other nurses, is obtaining a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN), a four-year degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For the first two years in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. In some new programs the first two years can be substituted for an active LPN license along with the required general studies. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an on the job training approach to educating students, while the BSN is an [[academic degree]] that emphasizes research and [[nursing theory]]. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience that is the same for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions. Nursing schools may be accredited by either the [[Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing]] (ACEN) or the [[Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education]] (CCNE).\n\n======Graduate education======\n{{Further|Master of Science in Nursing|Doctor of Nursing Practice}}\n\nAdvanced education in nursing is done at the master's and doctoral levels. It prepares the graduate for specialization as an [[advanced practice registered nurse]] (APRN) or for advanced roles in leadership, management, or education. The [[clinical nurse leader]] (CNL) is an advanced generalist who focuses on the improvement of quality and safety outcomes for patients or patient populations from an administrative and staff management focus. Doctoral programs in nursing prepare the student for work in nursing education, health care administration, clinical research, public policy, or advanced clinical practice. Most programs confer the PhD in nursing or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP).\n\n[[Advanced practice registered nurse]] (APRN)\n\nAreas of advanced nursing practice include that of a [[nurse practitioner]] (NP), a certified [[nurse midwife]] (CNM), a [[nurse anesthetist|certified registered nurse anesthetist]] (CRNA), or a [[clinical nurse specialist]] (CNS). Nurse practitioners and CNSs work assessing, diagnosing and treating patients in fields as diverse as [[family practice]], women's health care, [[emergency nursing]], acute/critical care, [[psychiatry]], [[geriatrics]], or [[pediatrics]], additionally, a CNS usually works for a facility to improve patient care, do research, or as a staff educator.\n\n=====Licensure examination=====\n\nCompletion of any one of these three educational routes allows a graduate nurse to take the [[NCLEX-RN]], the test for [[nurse licensure|licensure]] as a registered nurse, and is accepted by every state as an adequate indicator of minimum competency for a new graduate. However, controversy exists over the appropriate entry-level preparation of RNs. Some professional organizations believe the BSN should be the sole method of RN preparation and ADN graduates should be licensed as \"technical nurses\" to work under the supervision of BSN graduates. Others feel the on-the-job experiences of diploma and ADN graduates makes up for any deficiency in theoretical preparation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n=====Shortage in the United States=====\n{{Main article|Nursing shortage}}\nRNs are the largest group of health care workers in the United States, with about 2.7&nbsp;million employed in 2011.<ref name=\"bls.gov\">[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291111.htm Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2013 Registered Nurses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811044058/http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291111.htm |date=11 August 2012 }}</ref> It has been reported{{By whom|date=July 2012}} that the number of new graduates and foreign-trained nurses is insufficient to meet the [[demand]] for registered nurses; this is often referred to as the [[nursing shortage]] and is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to increase for the foreseeable future.

In 2006 it was estimated that approximately 1.8&nbsp;million nurses chose not to work as a nurse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that 296,900 healthcare jobs were created in 2011. RNs make up the majority of the healthcare work force, therefore these positions will be filled primarily by nurses. The BLS also stated that by 2020, there would be 1.2&nbsp;million nursing job openings due to an increase in the workforce, and replacements.<ref>Rosseter, 2012.</ref>\n\n======Causes======\n{{Speculation|section|date=July 2012}}\nThe International Council of Nursing (ICN), the largest international health professional organization in the world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals.<ref name=\"bls.gov\"/> However, due to administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.<ref name=\"isbn0-8160-6587-X\">{{cite book |title=Nursing (Ferguson's Careers in Focus) |publisher=Ferguson |location=New York, N.Y. |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/careersinfocusnu0000unse_l8r2/page/188 188] |isbn=978-0-8160-6587-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/careersinfocusnu0000unse_l8r2/page/188 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nardi, Deena A. 2013\">Nardi, Deena A., and Charlene C.

The serious need for educational capacity is not being met, which is the underlying most important preparation resource for the nurses of tomorrow. The decrease in faculty everywhere is due to many factors including decrease in satisfaction with the workforce, poor salaries, and reduction in full-time equivalent. Throughout the span of 6 years the nursing faculty shortage has been written about an increasing amount. There is no clear consensus or an organized plan on how to fix the ongoing issue.<ref>Nardi, Deena A., and Charlene C.

Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|title=FAQs: Contact Hours (CNE Credit)|access-date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024758/http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|archive-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky.

Completion of the prerequisite work experience allows an RN to register for an examination, and passage gives an RN permission to use a professional designation after their name. For example, passage of the American Association of Critical-care Nurses specialty exam allows a nurse to use the initials 'CCRN' after his or her name. Other organizations and societies have similar procedures.\n\nThe [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]], the credentialing arm of the [[American Nurses Association]], is the largest nursing credentialing organization and administers more than 30 specialty examinations.<ref name=\"ANCC\">American Nurses Credentialing Center.

Here they can discover existing conditions or even signs of substance abuse. A correctional nurse can face a wide variety of healthcare issues including chronic medical conditions, mental health, infectious disease, and much more. Correctional nurses must follow stricter protocols than in a hospital due to confidentiality. Assessing a patient can be difficult. A deputy or officer may have to be present during exams, which can make the patient feel restricted, and be less open with their medical information. Without the nurse knowing some information from the patient, prevent them from receiving the best care possible.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\n====Canada====\n{{Main article|Nursing in Canada}}\n\n=====History=====\nCanadian nursing dates back to 1639 in [[Quebec]] with the Augustine nuns.<ref name=\"test2\">[http://www.cna-nurses.ca/CNA/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx Link text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229233442/http://www.cna-nurses.ca/cna/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx|date=29 December 2011}}.</ref> These nuns were trying to open a mission that cared for the spiritual and physical needs of patients.

Most nurses were female and only had an occasional consultation with a physician. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded.

In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in Ontario.<ref name=\"test2\" />\n\n====Education====\nAll Canadian nurses and prospective nurses are heavily encouraged by the [[Canadian Nurses Association]] to continue their education to receive a [[bachelor's degree]].

They were previously known by titles such as Registered General Nurse (RGN), Registered Sick Children's Nurse (RSCN), Registered Mental Nurse (RMN), and Registered Nurse (for the) Mentally Handicapped (RNMH). The titles used now are similar, including Registered Nurse Adult (RNA), Registered Nurse Child (RNC), Registered Nurse Mental Health (RNMH), and Registered Nurse (of) Learning Disabilities (RNLD). Second-level nurse training is no longer provided; however, they are still legally able to practice in the United Kingdom as a registered nurse. Many have now either retired or undertaken conversion courses to become first-level nurses. They are entitled to refer to themselves as registered nurses as their registration is on the Nursing & Midwifery Council register of nurses, although most refer to themselves as Enrolled Nurses (ENs) or State Enrolled Nurses (SENs).\n\n=====Advanced practice=====\n\n* ''Nurse practitioners'' \u2013 Most of these nurses obtain a minimum of a master's degree and a desired post grad certificate. They often perform roles similar to those of physicians and physician assistants. They can prescribe medications as independent or supplementary prescribers, although they are still legally regulated, unlike physician's assistants. Most Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have referral and admission rights to hospital specialties. They commonly work in [[primary care]] (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) surgeries), [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments]], or pediatrics although they are increasingly being seen in other areas of practice. In the UK, the title \"nurse practitioner\" is legally protected.\n* ''Specialist community public health nurses'' \u2013 traditionally [[district nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s, this group oversees research and publication activities.\n* ''Lecturer-practitioners (also called practice education facilitators)'' \u2013 these nurses work both in the National Health Service (NHS), and in universities. They typically work 2\u20133 days per week in each setting. In university, they train pre-registration student nurses (see below), and often teach on specialist courses post-registration nurses.\n* ''Lecturers'' \u2013 these nurses are not employed by the NHS. Instead they work full-time in universities, both teaching and performing research.\n\n=====Managers=====\nMany nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions, however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option.\n\nNonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organizations, some even as board members. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming clinical nurse managers or ''[[Matron|modern matrons]]''.\n\n=====Nurse education=====\n======Pre-registration======\nTo become a registered nurse, one must complete a program recognised by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC). Currently, this involves completing a [[Academic degree|degree]], available from a range of [[:Category:Nursing schools in the United Kingdom|universities offering these courses]], in the chosen branch specialty (see below), leading to both an academic award and professional registration as a 1st level registered nurse. Such a course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (i.e. through lectures, assignments and examinations) and in practice (i.e. supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting).\n\nThese courses are three (occasionally four) years' long. The first year is known as the common foundation program (CFP), and teaches the basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. Skills included in the CFP may include communication, taking observations, administering medication and providing personal care to patients. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. These are:\n\n* Child nursing\n* Mental health nursing\n* Learning disabilities nursing\n\n{{As of|2013}}, the Nursing and Midwifery Council will require all new nurses qualifying in the UK to hold a degree qualification.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/2\">{{cite web|title=Changes to pre-registration nursing programmes: FAQs &#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Nmc-uk.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727073118/http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|archive-date=27 July 2011|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> However, those nurses who hold a diploma, or even a certificate in nursing are still able to legally practice in the UK, although they are able to undertake university modules to obtain enough credits to top up to a degree.\n\n[[Midwifery]] training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18-month) programs to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. Shortened courses lasting 2 years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation program.<ref name=\"NMC2\">Nursing and Midwifery Council [http://www.nmc.org.uk Pre-registration training.] London: NMC, 2003.</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016}} student nurses in England and Wales can apply for a [[bursary]] from the government to support them during their nurse training, and may also be eligible for a student loan, although there has been speculation that this will not be available in the future.<ref name=\"nursingtimes2\">{{cite web|title=Student bursary system 'unsustainable', claims minister in response to editors|url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/education/bursary-system-unsustainable-claims-minister-03-10-2016/|website=Nursing Times|date=3 October 2016|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> Student nurses in Scotland still receive a standard bursary which is not means tested, and their tuition fees continue to be paid \u2013 however, they are not eligible for student loans.\n\nBefore Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; hence many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\n\n======Post-registration======\nAfter the point of initial registration, there is an expectation that all qualified nurses will continue to update their skills and knowledge. The Nursing and Midwifery Council insists on a minimum of 35 hours of education every three years, as part of its post registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/2\">{{cite web|title=Post Registration Education and Practice (Prep) requirements for midwives &#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/|publisher=Nmc-uk.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126092059/http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/|archive-date=26 November 2010|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere are also opportunities for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. [[Cannulation]], [[venipuncture]], [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drug therapy]] and [[Urinary catheterization|male catheterization]] are the most common, although there are many others (such as [[advanced life support]]), which some nurses undertake.\n\nMany nurses who qualified with a diploma choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field as a part of this upgrading. Financially, in England, it was also much more lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary.<ref name=\"Nursing and Midwifery Education, 20072\">Nursing and Midwifery Education, 2007</ref>\n\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. [[District nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training. This is a one-year full-time degree.\n\nAll newly qualifying [[district nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s are trained to prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary, a list of medications and dressings typically useful to those carrying out these roles. Many of these (and other) nurses will also undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allows them (as of 1 May 2006) to prescribe almost any drug in the [[British National Formulary]]. This has been the cause of a great deal of debate in both medical and nursing circles.<ref name=\"BFN2\">{{cite web|title=BNF Publications|url=http://bnf.org/bnf/index.htm|author=BNF Publications}}</ref>\n\n====European Union====\nIn the European Union, the profession of nurse is regulated.

During those times, the United Kingdom regulated midwifery in Mandatory Palestine, but the nurses were not mentioned in the regulation decree.\n\nToday, nurses and midwives are regulated by the [[Israeli Ministry of Health]].\n\n====Japan====\n{{main article|Nursing in Japan}}\n\n=====History=====\nNursing was not an established part of Japan's healthcare system until 1899 with the Midwives Ordinance.<ref name=\"nurse3\">{{cite web|title=Nursing in Japan \u2013 Overview of Japanese Nursing System|url=http://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/system.html|website=nurse.or.jp|access-date=25 February 2018|archive-date=11 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311091329/http://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/system.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> From there the Registered Nurse Ordinance came into play in 1915. This established a legal substantiation to registered nurses all over Japan. A new law geared towards nurses was created during [[World War II]]: the ''Public Health Nurse, Midwife and Nurse Law'', established in 1948.<ref name=\"test2\" /> It established educational requirements, standards and licensure. There has been a continued effort to improve nursing in Japan. In 1992 the Nursing Human Resource Law was passed.<ref name=\"test2\" /> This law created the development of new university programs for nurses. Those programs were designed to raise the education level of the nurses so that they could be better suited for taking care of the public.\n\n=====Types of nurses=====\nJapan only recognizes four types of nursing and they are [[Public Health Nursing]], [[Midwifery]], Registered Nursing and Assistant Nursing.\n\n======Public health======\nThis type of nursing is designed to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on how to care for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters.\n\n======Midwifery======\nNurses that are involved with midwifery are independent of any organization. A [[midwife]] takes care of a pregnant woman during labour and postpartum. They assist with things like breastfeeding and caring for the child.\n\n======Nursing assistant======\nNursing assistants, also known as nurse assistants or CNAs (Certified Nursing Assistants), assist patients with basic daily tasks. Individuals who are assistant nurses follow orders from a registered nurse. They report back to the licensed nurse about a patient's condition. Assistant nurses are always supervised by a licensed registered nurse.\n\n=====Education=====\nIn 1952 Japan established the first nursing university in the country.<ref name=\"test2\" /> An [[Associate of Science in Nursing|associate degree]] was the only level of certification for years. Soon people began to want nursing degrees at a higher level of education. Soon the [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|Bachelor's Degree in Nursing]] (BSN) was established. Currently, Japan offers [[Doctorate in Nursing|doctorate]]-level degrees of nursing in a good number of its universities.\n\nThere are three ways that an individual could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person could go to a nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years.<ref name=\"test2\" /> Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of becoming a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan.<ref name=\"test2\" /> They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students to be able to make critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.\n\nStudents that attend a nursing college or just a nursing school receive the same degree as one who graduated from a nursing university would, but they do not have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a [[midwife]] or a public health nurse. They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college.<ref name=\"test2\" /> Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses. Once they have passed their exam, they have their license for life.<ref name=\"test2\" />\n\n=====Today=====\nLike the United States, Japan is in need of more nurses. The driving force behind this need is the fact that country is aging and needs more medical care for its people. However, the number of available nurses does not seem to be increasing. Nurses face poor working conditions and low social status, and there is a cultural idea that married women quit their jobs for family responsibilities.<ref name=\"nurse22\">{{cite web|title=Nursing in Japan \u2013 Working conditions in Japan|url=http://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/employment.html|website=nurse.or.jp|access-date=25 February 2018|archive-date=25 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225151221/https://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/employment.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> On average, Japanese nurses make around 280,000 yen a month, and it is one of the higher paying jobs.

According to the [[American Nurses Association]] article on Japan, \"nursing work has been described using negative terminology such as 'hard, dirty, dangerous, low salary, few holidays, minimal chance of marriage and family, and poor image.'\"\n\nThere are organizations that unite Japanese nurses like the [[Japanese Nursing Association]] (JNA); the JNA is a professional organization and not a union. Members of the JNA lobby politicians and produces publications about nursing. According to the American Nurses Association's article on Japan, the JNA \"works toward the improvement in nursing practice through many activities including the development of a policy research group to influence policy development, a code of ethics for nurses, and standards of nursing practice.\" The JNA also provides certification for specialists in mental health, oncology and community health.<ref name=\"test2\" /> There are other organizations, including some that categorize nurses by specialty, like emergency nursing or disaster nursing. One of the older unions that relates to nursing is the Japanese Federation of Medical Workers Union, which was created in 1957.<ref name=\"test2\" /> It is a union that includes physicians as well as nurses. This organization was involved with the '''Nursing Human Resource Law'''.<ref name=\"test2\" />\n\n====Philippines====\n{{main article|Nursing in the Philippines}}\nPhilippines is well known for migrant nurses working in other countries especially in the west like the United States of America.

The profession combines physical science, social science, nursing theory, and technology in caring for individuals and communities.\n\nTo work in the nursing profession, all nurses hold one or more credentials depending on their [[scope of practice]] and [[nurse education|education]]. In the United States, a [[Licensed Practical Nurse]] (LPN) works independently or with a [[Registered Nurse]] (RN). The most significant difference between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. RNs provide scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. RNs may earn additional [[Nursing credentials and certifications|credentials]] or [[academic degree|degrees]].\n\nIn the United States, multiple educational paths will qualify a candidate to sit for the licensure examination as an RN. An [[Associate of Science in Nursing|Associate Degree in Nursing]] (ADN) is awarded to those who have completed a two-year undergraduate academic degree awarded by community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, and bachelor's degree-granting colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study usually lasting two years. It is also referred to as an Associate in Nursing (AN), Associate of Applied Science in Nursing (AAS), or Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN/ASN)|url = http://www.collegeatlas.org/associate-degree-in-nursing.html|website = collegeatlas.org|access-date = 29 October 2015}}</ref> A [[#Bachelor of Science in Nursing|Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN) is awarded to those who have earned an American four-year academic degree in the science and principles of nursing, granted by a tertiary education university or similarly accredited school. After completing the LPN or either of the RN education programs in the United States, graduates are eligible to sit for a licensing examination to become a nurse, the passing of which is required for the nursing license. The [[National Council Licensure Examination|National Licensure Examination]] (NCLEX) test is a standardized exam (including multiple choice, select all that apply, fill in the blank and \"hot spot\" questions) that nurses take to become licensed.

This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including new technology that must be mastered, the emotional labor involved in nursing, physical labor, [[shift work]], and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including [[sleep disorders]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[Death|mortality]], psychiatric disorders, stress-related illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing [[compassion fatigue]] and moral [[distress (medicine)|distress]], which can worsen mental health. They also have very high rates of [[occupational burnout]] (40%) and [[emotional exhaustion]] (43.2%). Burnout and exhaustion increase the risk for illness, medical error, and suboptimal care provision.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/765974|title = Alleviating Job Stress in Nurses|date = 25 June 2012|newspaper = Medscape|publisher = Medscape and NIOSH|last1 = Roberts|first1 = Rashaun|last2 = Grubb|first2 = Paula L.|last3 = Grosch|first3 = James W.}}</ref>\n\n=== Workplace Violence ===\nNurses are also at risk for violence and abuse in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/12/hcwviolence-prevention/ |title = Free On-line Violence Prevention Training for Nurses |date = 12 August 2013 |first1 = Dan |last1 = Hartley |first2 = Marilyn |last2 = Ridenour |access-date = 15 January 2015 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> Violence is typically perpetrated by non-staff (e.g. patients or family), whereas abuse is typically perpetrated by other hospital personnel.

Each state has its own laws, rules, and regulations governing nursing care. Usually the making of such rules and regulations is delegated to a state [[board of nursing]], which performs day-to-day administration of these rules, licenses for nurses and nursing assistants, and makes decisions on nursing issues. In some states, the terms \"nurse\" or \"nursing\" may only be used in conjunction with the practice of a [[registered nurse]] (RN) or [[Licensed Practical Nurse|licensed practical or vocational nurse]] (LPN/LVN).\n\nIn the hospital setting, registered nurses often delegate tasks to LPNs and [[unlicensed assistive personnel]].\n\nRNs are not limited to employment as bedside nurses. They are employed by physicians, attorneys, insurance companies, governmental agencies, community/public health agencies, private industry, school districts, ambulatory surgery centers, among others. Some registered nurses are independent consultants who [[self-employed|work for themselves]], while others work for large manufacturers or chemical companies. Research nurses conduct or assist in the conduct of research or evaluation (outcome and process) in many areas such as biology, psychology, human development, and health care systems.\n\nMany employers offer flexible work schedules, child care, educational benefits, and bonuses. About 21 percent of registered nurses are union members or covered by union contract.<ref name=\"United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics\">United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics</ref>\n\nNursing is the nation's largest health care profession. In 2017, there were more than 4,015,250 registered nurses and 922,196 licensed practical nurses nationwide.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The U.S. Nursing Workforce in 2018 and Beyond |journal=Journal of Nursing Regulation |volume=8 |number=4 |year=2018 |pages=S3\u2013S6 |url=https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2019/10-20190613EnvironmentalScan2018.pdf}}</ref> Of all licensed RNs, 2.6&nbsp;million or 84.8% are employed in nursing. Nurses comprise the largest single component of hospital staff, are the primary providers of hospital patient care, and deliver most of the nation's long-term care. The primary pathway to professional nursing, as compared to technical-level practice, is the four-year Bachelor of Science in nursing (BSN) degree. Registered nurses are prepared either through a BSN program; a three-year associate degree in nursing; or a three-year hospital training program, receiving a hospital diploma. All take the same state licensing exam. (The number of diploma programs has declined steadily\u2014to less than 10 percent of all basic RN education programs\u2014as nursing education has shifted from hospital-operated instruction into the college and university system.)\n\n=====Educational and licensure requirements=====\n\n======Diploma in Nursing======\n{{main article|Diploma in Nursing}}\nThe oldest method of nursing education is the hospital-based diploma program, which lasts approximately three years. Students take between 30 and 60 credit hours in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[nutrition]], [[chemistry]], and other subjects at a college or university, then move on to intensive nursing classes. Until 1996, most RNs in the US were initially educated in nursing by diploma programs.<ref name=\"ANA\">American Nurses Association.

Some four-year colleges and universities also offer the ADN. Associate degree nursing programs have prerequisite and corequisite courses (which may include English, Math and Human Anatomy and Physiology) and ultimately stretch out the degree-acquiring process to about three years or greater.\n\n======Bachelor of Science in Nursing======\n{{main article|Bachelor of Science in Nursing}}\nAnother pathway into the profession, or a higher level of education for other nurses, is obtaining a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN), a four-year degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For the first two years in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. In some new programs the first two years can be substituted for an active LPN license along with the required general studies. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an on the job training approach to educating students, while the BSN is an [[academic degree]] that emphasizes research and [[nursing theory]]. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience that is the same for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions. Nursing schools may be accredited by either the [[Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing]] (ACEN) or the [[Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education]] (CCNE).\n\n======Graduate education======\n{{Further|Master of Science in Nursing|Doctor of Nursing Practice}}\n\nAdvanced education in nursing is done at the master's and doctoral levels. It prepares the graduate for specialization as an [[advanced practice registered nurse]] (APRN) or for advanced roles in leadership, management, or education. The [[clinical nurse leader]] (CNL) is an advanced generalist who focuses on the improvement of quality and safety outcomes for patients or patient populations from an administrative and staff management focus. Doctoral programs in nursing prepare the student for work in nursing education, health care administration, clinical research, public policy, or advanced clinical practice. Most programs confer the PhD in nursing or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP).\n\n[[Advanced practice registered nurse]] (APRN)\n\nAreas of advanced nursing practice include that of a [[nurse practitioner]] (NP), a certified [[nurse midwife]] (CNM), a [[nurse anesthetist|certified registered nurse anesthetist]] (CRNA), or a [[clinical nurse specialist]] (CNS). Nurse practitioners and CNSs work assessing, diagnosing and treating patients in fields as diverse as [[family practice]], women's health care, [[emergency nursing]], acute/critical care, [[psychiatry]], [[geriatrics]], or [[pediatrics]], additionally, a CNS usually works for a facility to improve patient care, do research, or as a staff educator.\n\n=====Licensure examination=====\n\nCompletion of any one of these three educational routes allows a graduate nurse to take the [[NCLEX-RN]], the test for [[nurse licensure|licensure]] as a registered nurse, and is accepted by every state as an adequate indicator of minimum competency for a new graduate. However, controversy exists over the appropriate entry-level preparation of RNs. Some professional organizations believe the BSN should be the sole method of RN preparation and ADN graduates should be licensed as \"technical nurses\" to work under the supervision of BSN graduates. Others feel the on-the-job experiences of diploma and ADN graduates makes up for any deficiency in theoretical preparation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n=====Shortage in the United States=====\n{{Main article|Nursing shortage}}\nRNs are the largest group of health care workers in the United States, with about 2.7&nbsp;million employed in 2011.<ref name=\"bls.gov\">[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291111.htm Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2013 Registered Nurses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811044058/http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291111.htm |date=11 August 2012 }}</ref> It has been reported{{By whom|date=July 2012}} that the number of new graduates and foreign-trained nurses is insufficient to meet the [[demand]] for registered nurses; this is often referred to as the [[nursing shortage]] and is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to increase for the foreseeable future.

In 2006 it was estimated that approximately 1.8&nbsp;million nurses chose not to work as a nurse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that 296,900 healthcare jobs were created in 2011. RNs make up the majority of the healthcare work force, therefore these positions will be filled primarily by nurses. The BLS also stated that by 2020, there would be 1.2&nbsp;million nursing job openings due to an increase in the workforce, and replacements.<ref>Rosseter, 2012.</ref>\n\n======Causes======\n{{Speculation|section|date=July 2012}}\nThe International Council of Nursing (ICN), the largest international health professional organization in the world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals.<ref name=\"bls.gov\"/> However, due to administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.<ref name=\"isbn0-8160-6587-X\">{{cite book |title=Nursing (Ferguson's Careers in Focus) |publisher=Ferguson |location=New York, N.Y. |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/careersinfocusnu0000unse_l8r2/page/188 188] |isbn=978-0-8160-6587-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/careersinfocusnu0000unse_l8r2/page/188 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nardi, Deena A. 2013\">Nardi, Deena A., and Charlene C.

The serious need for educational capacity is not being met, which is the underlying most important preparation resource for the nurses of tomorrow. The decrease in faculty everywhere is due to many factors including decrease in satisfaction with the workforce, poor salaries, and reduction in full-time equivalent. Throughout the span of 6 years the nursing faculty shortage has been written about an increasing amount. There is no clear consensus or an organized plan on how to fix the ongoing issue.<ref>Nardi, Deena A., and Charlene C.

Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|title=FAQs: Contact Hours (CNE Credit)|access-date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024758/http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|archive-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky.

Completion of the prerequisite work experience allows an RN to register for an examination, and passage gives an RN permission to use a professional designation after their name. For example, passage of the American Association of Critical-care Nurses specialty exam allows a nurse to use the initials 'CCRN' after his or her name. Other organizations and societies have similar procedures.\n\nThe [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]], the credentialing arm of the [[American Nurses Association]], is the largest nursing credentialing organization and administers more than 30 specialty examinations.<ref name=\"ANCC\">American Nurses Credentialing Center.

Nurses working in correctional care have to focus on the care of the patient, not what they did. They are to provide the best possible care because is a compassionate field and all nurses want is to better the patient.\n\nNurses are not the only health care workers in correctional facilities. Some examples of people who work in correctional facilities are LPNS, RNs, nurse practitioners, doctors, pharmacists, therapists, and specialists.<ref name=\":52\">{{Cite web |date=2019-08-12 |title=What to Expect as a Correctional Care Nurse and How to Avoid Burnout in Challenging Settings |url=https://nursing.usc.edu/blog/correctional-nurse-career/ |access-date=2022-03-10 |website=USC-MSN |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n====== Role of correctional nurse ======\nWhen the individual arrives, nurses perform an initial exam that is just a basic checkup to determine what needs the patient may have while in prison. Here they can discover existing conditions or even signs of substance abuse. A correctional nurse can face a wide variety of healthcare issues including chronic medical conditions, mental health, infectious disease, and much more. Correctional nurses must follow stricter protocols than in a hospital due to confidentiality. Assessing a patient can be difficult. A deputy or officer may have to be present during exams, which can make the patient feel restricted, and be less open with their medical information. Without the nurse knowing some information from the patient, prevent them from receiving the best care possible.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\n====Canada====\n{{Main article|Nursing in Canada}}\n\n=====History=====\nCanadian nursing dates back to 1639 in [[Quebec]] with the Augustine nuns.<ref name=\"test2\">[http://www.cna-nurses.ca/CNA/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx Link text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229233442/http://www.cna-nurses.ca/cna/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx|date=29 December 2011}}.</ref> These nuns were trying to open a mission that cared for the spiritual and physical needs of patients. The establishment of this mission created the first nursing apprenticeship training in North America.<ref name=\"test2\" /> In the nineteenth century, some Catholic orders of nursing were trying to spread their message across Canada. Most nurses were female and only had an occasional consultation with a physician. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded. Much of this was due to Nightingale's influence. In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in Ontario.<ref name=\"test2\" />\n\n====Education====\nAll Canadian nurses and prospective nurses are heavily encouraged by the [[Canadian Nurses Association]] to continue their education to receive a [[bachelor's degree]]. This degree may result in better patient outcomes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} All Canadian provinces and territories, with the exception of the [[Yukon]] and [[Quebec]], require that all nurses have a bachelor's degree.<ref name=\"test2\" /> The length of time generally required to obtain this degree is four years. However, some Canadian universities offer a condensed program that is two years in length.<ref name=\"test2\" />\n\nNursing specialty certification is available through the [[Canadian Nurses Association]] in 22 practice areas,<ref name=\"test2\" /> including:\n\n* cardiovascular nursing\n* community health nursing\n* [[critical care nursing]]\n* pediatric critical care nursing\n* [[emergency nursing]]\n* gastroenterology nursing\n* [[gerontological nursing]]\n* hospice palliative care nursing\n* [[medical-surgical nursing]]\n* [[neonatal nursing]]\n* nephrology nursing\n* [[neuroscience nursing]]\n* [[occupational health nursing]]\n* [[oncology nursing]]\n* [[orthopedic nursing]]\n* [[pediatric nursing]]\n* peri-anesthesia nursing\n* [[obstetrical nursing]]\n* peri-operative nursing\n* [[psychiatric and mental health nursing]]\n* rehabilitation nursing\n* [[Wound, ostomy, and continence nursing]]\n\nNursing specialty certification generally requires practice, experience, and passing a test that is based on competencies for that specific medical or surgical domain in which nursing care is provided. The certification in gerontological nursing, which involves providing care to the elderly, is offered to not only RNs and NPs but also LPNs.\n\n====Latin America====\nLatin American nursing is based on three levels of training: (a) professional/registered, (b) technical, and (c) auxiliary.<ref>{{cite book|title=Siantz, de Leon, M.L., Malv\u00e1rez, S., (31 May 2008) \"Migration of Nurses: A Latin American Perspective\" OJIN: The Online Journal of Issues in Nursing; Vol. 13 No. 2 Manuscript 2.}}</ref> The nursing education in Latin America and the Caribbean includes the principles and values of the Universal Health and primary health care.

They were previously known by titles such as Registered General Nurse (RGN), Registered Sick Children's Nurse (RSCN), Registered Mental Nurse (RMN), and Registered Nurse (for the) Mentally Handicapped (RNMH). The titles used now are similar, including Registered Nurse Adult (RNA), Registered Nurse Child (RNC), Registered Nurse Mental Health (RNMH), and Registered Nurse (of) Learning Disabilities (RNLD). Second-level nurse training is no longer provided; however, they are still legally able to practice in the United Kingdom as a registered nurse. Many have now either retired or undertaken conversion courses to become first-level nurses. They are entitled to refer to themselves as registered nurses as their registration is on the Nursing & Midwifery Council register of nurses, although most refer to themselves as Enrolled Nurses (ENs) or State Enrolled Nurses (SENs).\n\n=====Advanced practice=====\n\n* ''Nurse practitioners'' \u2013 Most of these nurses obtain a minimum of a master's degree and a desired post grad certificate. They often perform roles similar to those of physicians and physician assistants. They can prescribe medications as independent or supplementary prescribers, although they are still legally regulated, unlike physician's assistants. Most Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have referral and admission rights to hospital specialties. They commonly work in [[primary care]] (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) surgeries), [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments]], or pediatrics although they are increasingly being seen in other areas of practice. In the UK, the title \"nurse practitioner\" is legally protected.\n* ''Specialist community public health nurses'' \u2013 traditionally [[district nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s, this group oversees research and publication activities.\n* ''Lecturer-practitioners (also called practice education facilitators)'' \u2013 these nurses work both in the National Health Service (NHS), and in universities. They typically work 2\u20133 days per week in each setting. In university, they train pre-registration student nurses (see below), and often teach on specialist courses post-registration nurses.\n* ''Lecturers'' \u2013 these nurses are not employed by the NHS. Instead they work full-time in universities, both teaching and performing research.\n\n=====Managers=====\nMany nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions, however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option.\n\nNonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organizations, some even as board members. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming clinical nurse managers or ''[[Matron|modern matrons]]''.\n\n=====Nurse education=====\n======Pre-registration======\nTo become a registered nurse, one must complete a program recognised by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC). Currently, this involves completing a [[Academic degree|degree]], available from a range of [[:Category:Nursing schools in the United Kingdom|universities offering these courses]], in the chosen branch specialty (see below), leading to both an academic award and professional registration as a 1st level registered nurse. Such a course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (i.e. through lectures, assignments and examinations) and in practice (i.e. supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting).\n\nThese courses are three (occasionally four) years' long. The first year is known as the common foundation program (CFP), and teaches the basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. Skills included in the CFP may include communication, taking observations, administering medication and providing personal care to patients. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. These are:\n\n* Child nursing\n* Mental health nursing\n* Learning disabilities nursing\n\n{{As of|2013}}, the Nursing and Midwifery Council will require all new nurses qualifying in the UK to hold a degree qualification.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/2\">{{cite web|title=Changes to pre-registration nursing programmes: FAQs &#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Nmc-uk.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727073118/http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|archive-date=27 July 2011|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> However, those nurses who hold a diploma, or even a certificate in nursing are still able to legally practice in the UK, although they are able to undertake university modules to obtain enough credits to top up to a degree.\n\n[[Midwifery]] training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18-month) programs to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. Shortened courses lasting 2 years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation program.<ref name=\"NMC2\">Nursing and Midwifery Council [http://www.nmc.org.uk Pre-registration training.] London: NMC, 2003.</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016}} student nurses in England and Wales can apply for a [[bursary]] from the government to support them during their nurse training, and may also be eligible for a student loan, although there has been speculation that this will not be available in the future.<ref name=\"nursingtimes2\">{{cite web|title=Student bursary system 'unsustainable', claims minister in response to editors|url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/education/bursary-system-unsustainable-claims-minister-03-10-2016/|website=Nursing Times|date=3 October 2016|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> Student nurses in Scotland still receive a standard bursary which is not means tested, and their tuition fees continue to be paid \u2013 however, they are not eligible for student loans.\n\nBefore Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; hence many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\n\n======Post-registration======\nAfter the point of initial registration, there is an expectation that all qualified nurses will continue to update their skills and knowledge. The Nursing and Midwifery Council insists on a minimum of 35 hours of education every three years, as part of its post registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/2\">{{cite web|title=Post Registration Education and Practice (Prep) requirements for midwives &#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/|publisher=Nmc-uk.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126092059/http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/|archive-date=26 November 2010|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere are also opportunities for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. [[Cannulation]], [[venipuncture]], [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drug therapy]] and [[Urinary catheterization|male catheterization]] are the most common, although there are many others (such as [[advanced life support]]), which some nurses undertake.\n\nMany nurses who qualified with a diploma choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field as a part of this upgrading. Financially, in England, it was also much more lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary.<ref name=\"Nursing and Midwifery Education, 20072\">Nursing and Midwifery Education, 2007</ref>\n\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. [[District nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training. This is a one-year full-time degree.\n\nAll newly qualifying [[district nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s are trained to prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary, a list of medications and dressings typically useful to those carrying out these roles. Many of these (and other) nurses will also undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allows them (as of 1 May 2006) to prescribe almost any drug in the [[British National Formulary]]. This has been the cause of a great deal of debate in both medical and nursing circles.<ref name=\"BFN2\">{{cite web|title=BNF Publications|url=http://bnf.org/bnf/index.htm|author=BNF Publications}}</ref>\n\n====European Union====\nIn the European Union, the profession of nurse is regulated.

During those times, the United Kingdom regulated midwifery in Mandatory Palestine, but the nurses were not mentioned in the regulation decree.\n\nToday, nurses and midwives are regulated by the [[Israeli Ministry of Health]].\n\n====Japan====\n{{main article|Nursing in Japan}}\n\n=====History=====\nNursing was not an established part of Japan's healthcare system until 1899 with the Midwives Ordinance.<ref name=\"nurse3\">{{cite web|title=Nursing in Japan \u2013 Overview of Japanese Nursing System|url=http://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/system.html|website=nurse.or.jp|access-date=25 February 2018|archive-date=11 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311091329/http://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/system.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> From there the Registered Nurse Ordinance came into play in 1915. This established a legal substantiation to registered nurses all over Japan. A new law geared towards nurses was created during [[World War II]]: the ''Public Health Nurse, Midwife and Nurse Law'', established in 1948.<ref name=\"test2\" /> It established educational requirements, standards and licensure. There has been a continued effort to improve nursing in Japan. In 1992 the Nursing Human Resource Law was passed.<ref name=\"test2\" /> This law created the development of new university programs for nurses. Those programs were designed to raise the education level of the nurses so that they could be better suited for taking care of the public.\n\n=====Types of nurses=====\nJapan only recognizes four types of nursing and they are [[Public Health Nursing]], [[Midwifery]], Registered Nursing and Assistant Nursing.\n\n======Public health======\nThis type of nursing is designed to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on how to care for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters.\n\n======Midwifery======\nNurses that are involved with midwifery are independent of any organization. A [[midwife]] takes care of a pregnant woman during labour and postpartum. They assist with things like breastfeeding and caring for the child.\n\n======Nursing assistant======\nNursing assistants, also known as nurse assistants or CNAs (Certified Nursing Assistants), assist patients with basic daily tasks. Individuals who are assistant nurses follow orders from a registered nurse. They report back to the licensed nurse about a patient's condition. Assistant nurses are always supervised by a licensed registered nurse.\n\n=====Education=====\nIn 1952 Japan established the first nursing university in the country.<ref name=\"test2\" /> An [[Associate of Science in Nursing|associate degree]] was the only level of certification for years. Soon people began to want nursing degrees at a higher level of education. Soon the [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|Bachelor's Degree in Nursing]] (BSN) was established. Currently, Japan offers [[Doctorate in Nursing|doctorate]]-level degrees of nursing in a good number of its universities.\n\nThere are three ways that an individual could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person could go to a nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years.<ref name=\"test2\" /> Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of becoming a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan.<ref name=\"test2\" /> They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students to be able to make critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.\n\nStudents that attend a nursing college or just a nursing school receive the same degree as one who graduated from a nursing university would, but they do not have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a [[midwife]] or a public health nurse. They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college.<ref name=\"test2\" /> Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses. Once they have passed their exam, they have their license for life.<ref name=\"test2\" />\n\n=====Today=====\nLike the United States, Japan is in need of more nurses. The driving force behind this need is the fact that country is aging and needs more medical care for its people. However, the number of available nurses does not seem to be increasing. Nurses face poor working conditions and low social status, and there is a cultural idea that married women quit their jobs for family responsibilities.<ref name=\"nurse22\">{{cite web|title=Nursing in Japan \u2013 Working conditions in Japan|url=http://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/employment.html|website=nurse.or.jp|access-date=25 February 2018|archive-date=25 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225151221/https://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/employment.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> On average, Japanese nurses make around 280,000 yen a month, and it is one of the higher paying jobs.

According to the [[American Nurses Association]] article on Japan, \"nursing work has been described using negative terminology such as 'hard, dirty, dangerous, low salary, few holidays, minimal chance of marriage and family, and poor image.'\"\n\nThere are organizations that unite Japanese nurses like the [[Japanese Nursing Association]] (JNA); the JNA is a professional organization and not a union. Members of the JNA lobby politicians and produces publications about nursing. According to the American Nurses Association's article on Japan, the JNA \"works toward the improvement in nursing practice through many activities including the development of a policy research group to influence policy development, a code of ethics for nurses, and standards of nursing practice.\" The JNA also provides certification for specialists in mental health, oncology and community health.<ref name=\"test2\" /> There are other organizations, including some that categorize nurses by specialty, like emergency nursing or disaster nursing.

Nurses comprise the largest single component of hospital staff, are the primary providers of hospital patient care, and deliver most of the nation's long-term care. The primary pathway to professional nursing, as compared to technical-level practice, is the four-year Bachelor of Science in nursing (BSN) degree. Registered nurses are prepared either through a BSN program; a three-year associate degree in nursing; or a three-year hospital training program, receiving a hospital diploma. All take the same state licensing exam. (The number of diploma programs has declined steadily\u2014to less than 10 percent of all basic RN education programs\u2014as nursing education has shifted from hospital-operated instruction into the college and university system.)\n\n=====Educational and licensure requirements=====\n\n======Diploma in Nursing======\n{{main article|Diploma in Nursing}}\nThe oldest method of nursing education is the hospital-based diploma program, which lasts approximately three years. Students take between 30 and 60 credit hours in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[nutrition]], [[chemistry]], and other subjects at a college or university, then move on to intensive nursing classes. Until 1996, most RNs in the US were initially educated in nursing by diploma programs.<ref name=\"ANA\">American Nurses Association.

Some four-year colleges and universities also offer the ADN. Associate degree nursing programs have prerequisite and corequisite courses (which may include English, Math and Human Anatomy and Physiology) and ultimately stretch out the degree-acquiring process to about three years or greater.\n\n======Bachelor of Science in Nursing======\n{{main article|Bachelor of Science in Nursing}}\nAnother pathway into the profession, or a higher level of education for other nurses, is obtaining a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN), a four-year degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For the first two years in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. In some new programs the first two years can be substituted for an active LPN license along with the required general studies. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an on the job training approach to educating students, while the BSN is an [[academic degree]] that emphasizes research and [[nursing theory]]. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience that is the same for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions. Nursing schools may be accredited by either the [[Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing]] (ACEN) or the [[Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education]] (CCNE).\n\n======Graduate education======\n{{Further|Master of Science in Nursing|Doctor of Nursing Practice}}\n\nAdvanced education in nursing is done at the master's and doctoral levels. It prepares the graduate for specialization as an [[advanced practice registered nurse]] (APRN) or for advanced roles in leadership, management, or education. The [[clinical nurse leader]] (CNL) is an advanced generalist who focuses on the improvement of quality and safety outcomes for patients or patient populations from an administrative and staff management focus. Doctoral programs in nursing prepare the student for work in nursing education, health care administration, clinical research, public policy, or advanced clinical practice. Most programs confer the PhD in nursing or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP).\n\n[[Advanced practice registered nurse]] (APRN)\n\nAreas of advanced nursing practice include that of a [[nurse practitioner]] (NP), a certified [[nurse midwife]] (CNM), a [[nurse anesthetist|certified registered nurse anesthetist]] (CRNA), or a [[clinical nurse specialist]] (CNS). Nurse practitioners and CNSs work assessing, diagnosing and treating patients in fields as diverse as [[family practice]], women's health care, [[emergency nursing]], acute/critical care, [[psychiatry]], [[geriatrics]], or [[pediatrics]], additionally, a CNS usually works for a facility to improve patient care, do research, or as a staff educator.\n\n=====Licensure examination=====\n\nCompletion of any one of these three educational routes allows a graduate nurse to take the [[NCLEX-RN]], the test for [[nurse licensure|licensure]] as a registered nurse, and is accepted by every state as an adequate indicator of minimum competency for a new graduate. However, controversy exists over the appropriate entry-level preparation of RNs. Some professional organizations believe the BSN should be the sole method of RN preparation and ADN graduates should be licensed as \"technical nurses\" to work under the supervision of BSN graduates. Others feel the on-the-job experiences of diploma and ADN graduates makes up for any deficiency in theoretical preparation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n=====Shortage in the United States=====\n{{Main article|Nursing shortage}}\nRNs are the largest group of health care workers in the United States, with about 2.7&nbsp;million employed in 2011.<ref name=\"bls.gov\">[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291111.htm Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2013 Registered Nurses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811044058/http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291111.htm |date=11 August 2012 }}</ref> It has been reported{{By whom|date=July 2012}} that the number of new graduates and foreign-trained nurses is insufficient to meet the [[demand]] for registered nurses; this is often referred to as the [[nursing shortage]] and is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to increase for the foreseeable future.

RNs make up the majority of the healthcare work force, therefore these positions will be filled primarily by nurses. The BLS also stated that by 2020, there would be 1.2&nbsp;million nursing job openings due to an increase in the workforce, and replacements.<ref>Rosseter, 2012.</ref>\n\n======Causes======\n{{Speculation|section|date=July 2012}}\nThe International Council of Nursing (ICN), the largest international health professional organization in the world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals.<ref name=\"bls.gov\"/> However, due to administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.<ref name=\"isbn0-8160-6587-X\">{{cite book |title=Nursing (Ferguson's Careers in Focus) |publisher=Ferguson |location=New York, N.Y. |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/careersinfocusnu0000unse_l8r2/page/188 188] |isbn=978-0-8160-6587-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/careersinfocusnu0000unse_l8r2/page/188 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nardi, Deena A. 2013\">Nardi, Deena A., and Charlene C.

The serious need for educational capacity is not being met, which is the underlying most important preparation resource for the nurses of tomorrow. The decrease in faculty everywhere is due to many factors including decrease in satisfaction with the workforce, poor salaries, and reduction in full-time equivalent. Throughout the span of 6 years the nursing faculty shortage has been written about an increasing amount. There is no clear consensus or an organized plan on how to fix the ongoing issue.<ref>Nardi, Deena A., and Charlene C.

The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|title=FAQs: Contact Hours (CNE Credit)|access-date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024758/http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|archive-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky.

Completion of the prerequisite work experience allows an RN to register for an examination, and passage gives an RN permission to use a professional designation after their name. For example, passage of the American Association of Critical-care Nurses specialty exam allows a nurse to use the initials 'CCRN' after his or her name. Other organizations and societies have similar procedures.\n\nThe [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]], the credentialing arm of the [[American Nurses Association]], is the largest nursing credentialing organization and administers more than 30 specialty examinations.<ref name=\"ANCC\">American Nurses Credentialing Center.

Here they can discover existing conditions or even signs of substance abuse. A correctional nurse can face a wide variety of healthcare issues including chronic medical conditions, mental health, infectious disease, and much more. Correctional nurses must follow stricter protocols than in a hospital due to confidentiality. Assessing a patient can be difficult. A deputy or officer may have to be present during exams, which can make the patient feel restricted, and be less open with their medical information.

They are employed by physicians, attorneys, insurance companies, governmental agencies, community/public health agencies, private industry, school districts, ambulatory surgery centers, among others. Some registered nurses are independent consultants who [[self-employed|work for themselves]], while others work for large manufacturers or chemical companies. Research nurses conduct or assist in the conduct of research or evaluation (outcome and process) in many areas such as biology, psychology, human development, and health care systems.\n\nMany employers offer flexible work schedules, child care, educational benefits, and bonuses. About 21 percent of registered nurses are union members or covered by union contract.<ref name=\"United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics\">United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics</ref>\n\nNursing is the nation's largest health care profession. In 2017, there were more than 4,015,250 registered nurses and 922,196 licensed practical nurses nationwide.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The U.S. Nursing Workforce in 2018 and Beyond |journal=Journal of Nursing Regulation |volume=8 |number=4 |year=2018 |pages=S3\u2013S6 |url=https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2019/10-20190613EnvironmentalScan2018.pdf}}</ref> Of all licensed RNs, 2.6&nbsp;million or 84.8% are employed in nursing. Nurses comprise the largest single component of hospital staff, are the primary providers of hospital patient care, and deliver most of the nation's long-term care. The primary pathway to professional nursing, as compared to technical-level practice, is the four-year Bachelor of Science in nursing (BSN) degree. Registered nurses are prepared either through a BSN program; a three-year associate degree in nursing; or a three-year hospital training program, receiving a hospital diploma. All take the same state licensing exam. (The number of diploma programs has declined steadily\u2014to less than 10 percent of all basic RN education programs\u2014as nursing education has shifted from hospital-operated instruction into the college and university system.)\n\n=====Educational and licensure requirements=====\n\n======Diploma in Nursing======\n{{main article|Diploma in Nursing}}\nThe oldest method of nursing education is the hospital-based diploma program, which lasts approximately three years. Students take between 30 and 60 credit hours in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[nutrition]], [[chemistry]], and other subjects at a college or university, then move on to intensive nursing classes.

Some four-year colleges and universities also offer the ADN. Associate degree nursing programs have prerequisite and corequisite courses (which may include English, Math and Human Anatomy and Physiology) and ultimately stretch out the degree-acquiring process to about three years or greater.\n\n======Bachelor of Science in Nursing======\n{{main article|Bachelor of Science in Nursing}}\nAnother pathway into the profession, or a higher level of education for other nurses, is obtaining a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN), a four-year degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For the first two years in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. In some new programs the first two years can be substituted for an active LPN license along with the required general studies. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an on the job training approach to educating students, while the BSN is an [[academic degree]] that emphasizes research and [[nursing theory]]. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience that is the same for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions.

The [[clinical nurse leader]] (CNL) is an advanced generalist who focuses on the improvement of quality and safety outcomes for patients or patient populations from an administrative and staff management focus. Doctoral programs in nursing prepare the student for work in nursing education, health care administration, clinical research, public policy, or advanced clinical practice. Most programs confer the PhD in nursing or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP).\n\n[[Advanced practice registered nurse]] (APRN)\n\nAreas of advanced nursing practice include that of a [[nurse practitioner]] (NP), a certified [[nurse midwife]] (CNM), a [[nurse anesthetist|certified registered nurse anesthetist]] (CRNA), or a [[clinical nurse specialist]] (CNS). Nurse practitioners and CNSs work assessing, diagnosing and treating patients in fields as diverse as [[family practice]], women's health care, [[emergency nursing]], acute/critical care, [[psychiatry]], [[geriatrics]], or [[pediatrics]], additionally, a CNS usually works for a facility to improve patient care, do research, or as a staff educator.\n\n=====Licensure examination=====\n\nCompletion of any one of these three educational routes allows a graduate nurse to take the [[NCLEX-RN]], the test for [[nurse licensure|licensure]] as a registered nurse, and is accepted by every state as an adequate indicator of minimum competency for a new graduate.

Some professional organizations believe the BSN should be the sole method of RN preparation and ADN graduates should be licensed as \"technical nurses\" to work under the supervision of BSN graduates.

This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals.<ref name=\"bls.gov\"/> However, due to administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers.

The serious need for educational capacity is not being met, which is the underlying most important preparation resource for the nurses of tomorrow. The decrease in faculty everywhere is due to many factors including decrease in satisfaction with the workforce, poor salaries, and reduction in full-time equivalent. Throughout the span of 6 years the nursing faculty shortage has been written about an increasing amount. There is no clear consensus or an organized plan on how to fix the ongoing issue.<ref>Nardi, Deena A., and Charlene C.

Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|title=FAQs: Contact Hours (CNE Credit)|access-date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024758/http://www.nursecredentialing.org/AccredContactHoursFAQ|archive-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky.

Completion of the prerequisite work experience allows an RN to register for an examination, and passage gives an RN permission to use a professional designation after their name. For example, passage of the American Association of Critical-care Nurses specialty exam allows a nurse to use the initials 'CCRN' after his or her name. Other organizations and societies have similar procedures.\n\nThe [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]], the credentialing arm of the [[American Nurses Association]], is the largest nursing credentialing organization and administers more than 30 specialty examinations.<ref name=\"ANCC\">American Nurses Credentialing Center.

Correctional nurses must follow stricter protocols than in a hospital due to confidentiality. Assessing a patient can be difficult. A deputy or officer may have to be present during exams, which can make the patient feel restricted, and be less open with their medical information.

This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals.<ref name=\"bls.gov\"/> However, due to administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes is expected{{By whom|date=July 2012}} to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers.

They were previously known by titles such as Registered General Nurse (RGN), Registered Sick Children's Nurse (RSCN), Registered Mental Nurse (RMN), and Registered Nurse (for the) Mentally Handicapped (RNMH). The titles used now are similar, including Registered Nurse Adult (RNA), Registered Nurse Child (RNC), Registered Nurse Mental Health (RNMH), and Registered Nurse (of) Learning Disabilities (RNLD). Second-level nurse training is no longer provided; however, they are still legally able to practice in the United Kingdom as a registered nurse. Many have now either retired or undertaken conversion courses to become first-level nurses. They are entitled to refer to themselves as registered nurses as their registration is on the Nursing & Midwifery Council register of nurses, although most refer to themselves as Enrolled Nurses (ENs) or State Enrolled Nurses (SENs).\n\n=====Advanced practice=====\n\n* ''Nurse practitioners'' \u2013 Most of these nurses obtain a minimum of a master's degree and a desired post grad certificate. They often perform roles similar to those of physicians and physician assistants. They can prescribe medications as independent or supplementary prescribers, although they are still legally regulated, unlike physician's assistants. Most Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have referral and admission rights to hospital specialties. They commonly work in [[primary care]] (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) surgeries), [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments]], or pediatrics although they are increasingly being seen in other areas of practice. In the UK, the title \"nurse practitioner\" is legally protected.\n* ''Specialist community public health nurses'' \u2013 traditionally [[district nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s, this group oversees research and publication activities.\n* ''Lecturer-practitioners (also called practice education facilitators)'' \u2013 these nurses work both in the National Health Service (NHS), and in universities. They typically work 2\u20133 days per week in each setting. In university, they train pre-registration student nurses (see below), and often teach on specialist courses post-registration nurses.\n* ''Lecturers'' \u2013 these nurses are not employed by the NHS. Instead they work full-time in universities, both teaching and performing research.\n\n=====Managers=====\nMany nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions, however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option.\n\nNonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organizations, some even as board members. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming clinical nurse managers or ''[[Matron|modern matrons]]''.\n\n=====Nurse education=====\n======Pre-registration======\nTo become a registered nurse, one must complete a program recognised by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC). Currently, this involves completing a [[Academic degree|degree]], available from a range of [[:Category:Nursing schools in the United Kingdom|universities offering these courses]], in the chosen branch specialty (see below), leading to both an academic award and professional registration as a 1st level registered nurse. Such a course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (i.e. through lectures, assignments and examinations) and in practice (i.e. supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting).\n\nThese courses are three (occasionally four) years' long. The first year is known as the common foundation program (CFP), and teaches the basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. Skills included in the CFP may include communication, taking observations, administering medication and providing personal care to patients. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. These are:\n\n* Child nursing\n* Mental health nursing\n* Learning disabilities nursing\n\n{{As of|2013}}, the Nursing and Midwifery Council will require all new nurses qualifying in the UK to hold a degree qualification.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/2\">{{cite web|title=Changes to pre-registration nursing programmes: FAQs &#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Nmc-uk.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727073118/http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|archive-date=27 July 2011|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> However, those nurses who hold a diploma, or even a certificate in nursing are still able to legally practice in the UK, although they are able to undertake university modules to obtain enough credits to top up to a degree.\n\n[[Midwifery]] training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18-month) programs to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. Shortened courses lasting 2 years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation program.<ref name=\"NMC2\">Nursing and Midwifery Council [http://www.nmc.org.uk Pre-registration training.] London: NMC, 2003.</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016}} student nurses in England and Wales can apply for a [[bursary]] from the government to support them during their nurse training, and may also be eligible for a student loan, although there has been speculation that this will not be available in the future.<ref name=\"nursingtimes2\">{{cite web|title=Student bursary system 'unsustainable', claims minister in response to editors|url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/education/bursary-system-unsustainable-claims-minister-03-10-2016/|website=Nursing Times|date=3 October 2016|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> Student nurses in Scotland still receive a standard bursary which is not means tested, and their tuition fees continue to be paid \u2013 however, they are not eligible for student loans.\n\nBefore Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; hence many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\n\n======Post-registration======\nAfter the point of initial registration, there is an expectation that all qualified nurses will continue to update their skills and knowledge. The Nursing and Midwifery Council insists on a minimum of 35 hours of education every three years, as part of its post registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/2\">{{cite web|title=Post Registration Education and Practice (Prep) requirements for midwives &#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/|publisher=Nmc-uk.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126092059/http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/|archive-date=26 November 2010|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere are also opportunities for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. [[Cannulation]], [[venipuncture]], [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drug therapy]] and [[Urinary catheterization|male catheterization]] are the most common, although there are many others (such as [[advanced life support]]), which some nurses undertake.\n\nMany nurses who qualified with a diploma choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field as a part of this upgrading. Financially, in England, it was also much more lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary.<ref name=\"Nursing and Midwifery Education, 20072\">Nursing and Midwifery Education, 2007</ref>\n\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. [[District nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training. This is a one-year full-time degree.\n\nAll newly qualifying [[district nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s are trained to prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary, a list of medications and dressings typically useful to those carrying out these roles. Many of these (and other) nurses will also undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allows them (as of 1 May 2006) to prescribe almost any drug in the [[British National Formulary]].

They were previously known by titles such as Registered General Nurse (RGN), Registered Sick Children's Nurse (RSCN), Registered Mental Nurse (RMN), and Registered Nurse (for the) Mentally Handicapped (RNMH). The titles used now are similar, including Registered Nurse Adult (RNA), Registered Nurse Child (RNC), Registered Nurse Mental Health (RNMH), and Registered Nurse (of) Learning Disabilities (RNLD). Second-level nurse training is no longer provided; however, they are still legally able to practice in the United Kingdom as a registered nurse. Many have now either retired or undertaken conversion courses to become first-level nurses. They are entitled to refer to themselves as registered nurses as their registration is on the Nursing & Midwifery Council register of nurses, although most refer to themselves as Enrolled Nurses (ENs) or State Enrolled Nurses (SENs).\n\n=====Advanced practice=====\n\n* ''Nurse practitioners'' \u2013 Most of these nurses obtain a minimum of a master's degree and a desired post grad certificate. They often perform roles similar to those of physicians and physician assistants. They can prescribe medications as independent or supplementary prescribers, although they are still legally regulated, unlike physician's assistants. Most Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have referral and admission rights to hospital specialties. They commonly work in [[primary care]] (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) surgeries), [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments]], or pediatrics although they are increasingly being seen in other areas of practice. In the UK, the title \"nurse practitioner\" is legally protected.\n* ''Specialist community public health nurses'' \u2013 traditionally [[district nurse]]s and [[health visitor]]s, this group oversees research and publication activities.\n* ''Lecturer-practitioners (also called practice education facilitators)'' \u2013 these nurses work both in the National Health Service (NHS), and in universities. They typically work 2\u20133 days per week in each setting. In university, they train pre-registration student nurses (see below), and often teach on specialist courses post-registration nurses.\n* ''Lecturers'' \u2013 these nurses are not employed by the NHS. Instead they work full-time in universities, both teaching and performing research.\n\n=====Managers=====\nMany nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions, however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option.\n\nNonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organizations, some even as board members. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming clinical nurse managers or ''[[Matron|modern matrons]]''.\n\n=====Nurse education=====\n======Pre-registration======\nTo become a registered nurse, one must complete a program recognised by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC). Currently, this involves completing a [[Academic degree|degree]], available from a range of [[:Category:Nursing schools in the United Kingdom|universities offering these courses]], in the chosen branch specialty (see below), leading to both an academic award and professional registration as a 1st level registered nurse. Such a course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (i.e. through lectures, assignments and examinations) and in practice (i.e. supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting).\n\nThese courses are three (occasionally four) years' long. The first year is known as the common foundation program (CFP), and teaches the basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. Skills included in the CFP may include communication, taking observations, administering medication and providing personal care to patients. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. These are:\n\n* Child nursing\n* Mental health nursing\n* Learning disabilities nursing\n\n{{As of|2013}}, the Nursing and Midwifery Council will require all new nurses qualifying in the UK to hold a degree qualification.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/2\">{{cite web|title=Changes to pre-registration nursing programmes: FAQs &#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Nmc-uk.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727073118/http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/|archive-date=27 July 2011|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> However, those nurses who hold a diploma, or even a certificate in nursing are still able to legally practice in the UK, although they are able to undertake university modules to obtain enough credits to top up to a degree.\n\n[[Midwifery]] training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing.

Those programs were designed to raise the education level of the nurses so that they could be better suited for taking care of the public.\n\n=====Types of nurses=====\nJapan only recognizes four types of nursing and they are [[Public Health Nursing]], [[Midwifery]], Registered Nursing and Assistant Nursing.\n\n======Public health======\nThis type of nursing is designed to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on how to care for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters.\n\n======Midwifery======\nNurses that are involved with midwifery are independent of any organization. A [[midwife]] takes care of a pregnant woman during labour and postpartum. They assist with things like breastfeeding and caring for the child.\n\n======Nursing assistant======\nNursing assistants, also known as nurse assistants or CNAs (Certified Nursing Assistants), assist patients with basic daily tasks. Individuals who are assistant nurses follow orders from a registered nurse. They report back to the licensed nurse about a patient's condition. Assistant nurses are always supervised by a licensed registered nurse.\n\n=====Education=====\nIn 1952 Japan established the first nursing university in the country.<ref name=\"test2\" /> An [[Associate of Science in Nursing|associate degree]] was the only level of certification for years. Soon people began to want nursing degrees at a higher level of education. Soon the [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|Bachelor's Degree in Nursing]] (BSN) was established. Currently, Japan offers [[Doctorate in Nursing|doctorate]]-level degrees of nursing in a good number of its universities.\n\nThere are three ways that an individual could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person could go to a nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years.<ref name=\"test2\" /> Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of becoming a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan.<ref name=\"test2\" /> They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students to be able to make critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.\n\nStudents that attend a nursing college or just a nursing school receive the same degree as one who graduated from a nursing university would, but they do not have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a [[midwife]] or a public health nurse. They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college.<ref name=\"test2\" /> Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses. Once they have passed their exam, they have their license for life.<ref name=\"test2\" />\n\n=====Today=====\nLike the United States, Japan is in need of more nurses. The driving force behind this need is the fact that country is aging and needs more medical care for its people. However, the number of available nurses does not seem to be increasing. Nurses face poor working conditions and low social status, and there is a cultural idea that married women quit their jobs for family responsibilities.<ref name=\"nurse22\">{{cite web|title=Nursing in Japan \u2013 Working conditions in Japan|url=http://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/employment.html|website=nurse.or.jp|access-date=25 February 2018|archive-date=25 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225151221/https://www.nurse.or.jp/jna/english/nursing/employment.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> On average, Japanese nurses make around 280,000 yen a month, and it is one of the higher paying jobs.

Members of the JNA lobby politicians and produces publications about nursing. According to the American Nurses Association's article on Japan, the JNA \"works toward the improvement in nursing practice through many activities including the development of a policy research group to influence policy development, a code of ethics for nurses, and standards of nursing practice.\" The JNA also provides certification for specialists in mental health, oncology and community health.<ref name=\"test2\" /> There are other organizations, including some that categorize nurses by specialty, like emergency nursing or disaster nursing.
