A '''botanist''', '''plant scientist''' or '''phytologist''' is a [[scientist]] who specialises in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} (''{{Lang|grc-latn|botan\u0113}}'') meaning \"[[pasture]]\", \"[[herb]]s\" \"[[Poaceae|grass]]\", or \"[[fodder]]\"; {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} is in turn derived from {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} ({{transl|grc|boskein}}), \"to feed\" or \"to [[Grazing|graze]]\".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1940}}{{sfn|Gordh|Headrick|2001|p = 134}}{{sfn|Online Etymology Dictionary|2012}}  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of [[fungi]] and [[algae]] by [[mycologists]] and [[phycologists]] respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the [[International Botanical Congress]]. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 [[species]] of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] of which some 391,000 species are [[vascular plant]]s (including approximately 369,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s),{{sfn|RGB Kew|2016}} and approximately 20,000 are [[bryophyte]]s.{{sfn|The Plant List||2013}}\n\nBotany originated in prehistory as [[herbalism]] with the efforts of early humans to identify \u2013 and later cultivate \u2013 plants that were edible, poisonous, and possibly medicinal, making it one of the first endeavours of human investigation. Medieval [[physic garden]]s, often attached to [[Monastery|monasteries]], contained plants possibly having medicinal benefit. They were forerunners of the first [[botanical garden]]s attached to [[University|universities]], founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]]. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of [[plant taxonomy]], and led in 1753 to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system of nomenclature]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]] that remains in use to this day for the naming of all biological species.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of [[optical microscope|optical microscopy]] and [[live cell imaging]], [[electron microscopy]], analysis of [[ploidy|chromosome number]], [[phytochemistry|plant chemistry]] and the structure and function of [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of [[molecular biology|molecular genetic analysis]], including [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] and [[DNA sequences]] to classify plants more accurately.\n\nModern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with contributions and insights from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]] and differentiation, [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]], [[plant physiology#Biochemistry of plants|biochemistry]] and [[metabolism|primary metabolism]], chemical products, [[Plant morphology#Morphology in development|development]], [[plant pathology|diseases]], [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|plant taxonomy]]. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are [[molecular genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], which study the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of [[plant cell]]s and [[Tissue (biology)#Plant tissue|tissues]]. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing [[staple foods]], materials such as [[Lumber|timber]], [[oil]], rubber, [[Fiber|fibre]] and drugs, in modern [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], [[plant propagation]], [[Plant breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic modification]], in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in [[environmental management]], and the maintenance of [[biodiversity]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of botany}}\n\n=== Early botany ===\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|alt=engraving of cork cells from Hooke's Micrographia, 1665|An engraving of the cells of [[Cork oak|cork]], from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 275\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Renaissance C14 F\u00fcllmaurer Leonhart Fuchs.jpg\n | width1            = 700\n | height1           = 828\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Leonhart Fuchs]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Brunfels-1.png\n | width2            = 700\n | height2           = 828\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Otto Brunfels]]\n<!--image 3-->\n | image3            = Hieronymus Bock (1546).jpg\n | width3            = 700\n | height3           = 828\n | alt3              =\n | link3             =\n | caption3          = [[Hieronymus Bock]]\n}}\n\nBotany originated as [[herbalism]], the study and use of plants for their [[Medicinal plants|possible medicinal properties]].{{sfn|Sumner|2000|p = 16}} The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications.

In the early 13th century, [[Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati]], and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.{{sfn|Dallal|2010|p = 197}}{{sfn|Panaino|2002|p = 93}}{{sfn|Levey|1973|p = 116}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, [[botanical garden]]s were founded in a number of Italian universities. The [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]] in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier \"physic gardens\", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for suspected medicinal uses. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] in 1621.{{sfn|Hill|1915}}\n\nGerman physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501\u20131566) was one of \"the three German fathers of botany\", along with theologian [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489\u20131534) and physician [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498\u20131554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).{{sfn|National Museum of Wales|2007}}{{sfn|Yaniv|Bachrach|2005|p = 157}} Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.\n\nPhysician [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515\u20131544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal ''Historia Plantarum'' in 1544 and a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|Sprague|1939}} Naturalist [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516\u20131565) and herbalist [[John Gerard]] (1545\u2013{{circa|1611}}) published herbals covering the supposed medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522\u20131605) was considered the ''father of natural history'', which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}}\n\n=== Early modern botany ===\n{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)#History of taxonomy}}\n[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a garden|The [[Linnaean Garden]] of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted according to his ''Systema sexuale''.]]\n\nDuring the 18th century, systems of [[plant identification]] were developed comparable to [[single access key|dichotomous keys]], where unidentified plants are placed into [[taxon]]omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of [[Character (biology)|characters]]. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ([[single access key#Diagnostic ('artificial') versus synoptic ('natural') keys|diagnostic keys]]) or more closely related to the natural or [[taxonomic order|phyletic order]] of the [[taxon|taxa]] in synoptic keys.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp = 73\u2013117}} By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus]] published his [[Species Plantarum]], a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|modern botanical nomenclature]]. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the [[genus]] and the second identified the [[species]] within the genus.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 220\u2013223}} For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's ''Systema Sexuale'' [[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification of plants|classified]] plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p = 9}}\n\nIncreasing knowledge of [[plant anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. [[Michel Adanson|Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The [[Candollean system]] reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later [[Bentham & Hooker system]], which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s publication of the ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.{{sfn|Starr|2009|pp =299\u2013}}\n\nBotany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first \"modern\" textbook, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundz\u00fcge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 377}}  Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the [[cell theory]] with [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] and was among the first to grasp the significance of the [[cell nucleus]] that had been described by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.{{sfn|Harris|2000|pp = 76\u201381}} In 1855, [[Adolf Fick]] formulated [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's laws]] that enabled the calculation of the rates of [[molecular diffusion]] in biological systems.{{sfn|Small|2012|pp =118\u2013}}\n\n[[File:Echeveria glauca II.jpg|thumb|''Echeveria glauca'' in a Connecticut greenhouse.

The concept that the composition of plant communities such as [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]] changes by a process of [[ecological succession]] was developed by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]], [[Arthur Tansley]] and [[Frederic Clements]].

Their energy is used in the [[light-independent reactions]] of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme [[rubisco]] to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which [[glucose]] and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised.

[[Gregor Mendel]] discovered the [[Mendelian inheritance|genetic laws of inheritance]] by studying inherited traits such as shape in ''Pisum sativum'' ([[peas]]). What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far-reaching benefits outside of botany. Similarly, \"[[transposon|jumping genes]]\" were discovered by [[Barbara McClintock]] while she was studying maize.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|p = 5369}} Nevertheless, there are some distinctive genetic differences between plants and other organisms.\n\nSpecies boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are often possible.

This beneficial effect is also known as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Once outcrossing is established, subsequent switching to inbreeding becomes disadvantageous since it allows expression of the previously masked deleterious recessive mutations, commonly referred to as inbreeding depression.  \n\nUnlike in higher animals, where [[parthenogenesis]] is rare, [[asexual reproduction]] may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem [[tuber]]s in potato is one example. Particularly in [[arctic]] or [[alpine climate|alpine]] habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers [[zoophily|by animals]] are rare, plantlets or [[bulbs]], may develop instead of flowers, replacing [[sexual reproduction]] with asexual reproduction and giving rise to [[cloning|clonal populations]] genetically identical to the parent. This is one of several types of [[apomixis]] that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a [[seed]], producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.{{sfn|Savidan|2000|pp = 13\u201386}}\n\nMost sexually reproducing organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their [[chromosome number]] may occur due to errors in [[cytokinesis]]. This can occur early in development to produce an [[autopolyploid]] or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid ([[endopolyploidy]]), or during gamete formation. An [[allopolyploid]] plant may result from a [[hybridization event|hybridisation event]] between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are [[reproductively isolated]] from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new [[sympatric speciation|species]].{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce [[vegetative propagation|vegetatively]] or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} [[Durum]] wheat is a fertile [[tetraploid]] allopolyploid, while [[common wheat|bread wheat]] is a fertile [[hexaploid]]. The commercial banana is an example of a sterile, seedless [[triploid]] hybrid. [[Taraxacum officinale|Common dandelion]] is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.\n\nAs in other eukaryotes, the inheritance of [[endosymbiotic]] organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s in plants is non-[[Mendelian]].

Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code.

and Willd used {{angbr|\u2644}} (Saturn) for neuter in addition to {{angbr|\u263f}} (Mercury) for hermaphroditic.{{sfn|Lindley|1848}} The following symbols are still used:{{sfn|Simpson|2010}}\n\n:\u2640 female\n:\u2642 male\n:\u26a5 [[Hermaphrodite#Plants|hermaphrodite/bisexual]]\n:\u26b2 vegetative (asexual) reproduction\n:\u25ca sex unknown\n:\u2609 annual\n:\u2687 [[Biennial plant|biennial]]\n:\u267e [[Perennial plant|perennial]]\n:\u2620 poisonous\n:\ud83d\udec8 further information\n:\u00d7 crossbred hybrid\n:+ grafted hybrid\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Branches of botany]]\n* [[Evolution of plants]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]]\n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]]\n* [[List of botany journals]]\n* [[List of botanists]]\n* [[List of botanical gardens]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of domesticated plants]]\n* [[List of flowers]]\n* [[List of systems of plant taxonomy]]\n* [[Outline of botany]]\n* [[Timeline of British botany]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Portal|Plants|Biology}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|16em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n<!-- AAAA -->\n* {{cite book | last1 = Acharya | first1 = Deepak | last2 = Anshu | first2 = Shrivastava | title = Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-81-7910-252-7 | publisher = Aavishkar Publishers | location = Jaipur, India}}\n* {{cite web | last = Addelson | first = Barbara | url = http://www.bgci.org/education/article/414/ | title = Natural Science Institute in Botany and Ecology for Elementary Teachers | publisher = Botanical Gardens Conservation International | date = December 2003 | access-date = June 8, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130523155525/http://www.bgci.org/education/article/414 | archive-date = May 23, 2013 | url-status = dead }}\n* {{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Edward F. |year=2001 |title=The Cactus Family |location=Pentland, OR |publisher=Timber Press |isbn=978-0-88192-498-5}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=G.A.|last2=Hearst|first2=J.E. |s2cid=22385652|title=Carotenoids 2: Genetics and Molecular Biology of Carotenoid Pigment Biosynthesis |journal=FASEB J. |volume=10 |issue=2 |year=1996 |pmid=8641556|pages=228\u2013237|doi=10.1096/fasebj.10.2.8641556 |doi-access=free }}\n<!-- BBBB -->\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = Burkhard | last2 = Marin| first2 = Birger | title = Streptophyte Algae and the Origin of Embryophytes|journal=Annals of Botany | url= | year = 2009|doi= 10.1093/aob/mcp044 | volume = 103 | issue = 7| pmid = 19273476 | pmc = 2707909 | pages = 999\u20131004 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1 = Beerling |first1 = D.J. |author-link = David Beerling |last2 = Osborne |first2 = C.P. |last3 = Chaloner |first3 = W.G. |year = 2001 |title = Evolution of Leaf-form in Land Plants Linked to Atmospheric CO2 Decline in the Late Palaeozoic Era |journal = Nature |volume = 410 |issue = 6826 |doi = 10.1038/35066546 |pmid = 11268207 |pages = 352\u2013354 |bibcode = 2001Natur.410..352B |s2cid = 4386118 |url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/59/1/osbornecp2.pdf |access-date = 2018-12-14 |archive-date = 2010-09-20 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100920054036/http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/59/1/osbornecp2.pdf |url-status = live }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Benderoth | first1 = Markus | last2 = Textor | first2 = Susanne | last3 = Windsor | first3 = Aaron J. | last4 =  Mitchell-Olds | first4 = Thomas| last5 = Gershenzon | first5 = Jonathan | last6 = Kroymann| first6 = Juergen | title = Positive Selection Driving Diversification in Plant Secondary Metabolism |date=June 2006|volume=103|issue=24 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| jstor= 30051907| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0601738103| pmid = 16754868| pmc = 1482576|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.9118B| pages = 9118\u20139123 | doi-access = free }}\n* {{cite book | last = Ben-Menahem | first = Ari | title = Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-3-540-68831-0 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin|volume=1}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Charles E. | last2 = Hammond | first2 = William A. | title = The Characters of Theophrastus \u2013 Introduction | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n0JgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR30 | year = 1902 | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co. | location = London | access-date = June 27, 2012 | archive-date = February 10, 2023 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230210172545/https://books.google.com/books?id=n0JgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR30 | url-status = live }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Bennett|first1=K.D.|last2=Willis|first2= K.J.|chapter=Pollen|year=2001|title=Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments|volume= 3: Terrestrial, Algal, and Siliceous Indicators |editor-last=Smol|editor-first=John P.|editor2-last=Birks|editor2-first=H.

A '''botanist''', '''plant scientist''' or '''phytologist''' is a [[scientist]] who specialises in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} (''{{Lang|grc-latn|botan\u0113}}'') meaning \"[[pasture]]\", \"[[herb]]s\" \"[[Poaceae|grass]]\", or \"[[fodder]]\"; {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} is in turn derived from {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} ({{transl|grc|boskein}}), \"to feed\" or \"to [[Grazing|graze]]\".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1940}}{{sfn|Gordh|Headrick|2001|p = 134}}{{sfn|Online Etymology Dictionary|2012}}  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of [[fungi]] and [[algae]] by [[mycologists]] and [[phycologists]] respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the [[International Botanical Congress]]. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 [[species]] of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] of which some 391,000 species are [[vascular plant]]s (including approximately 369,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s),{{sfn|RGB Kew|2016}} and approximately 20,000 are [[bryophyte]]s.{{sfn|The Plant List||2013}}\n\nBotany originated in prehistory as [[herbalism]] with the efforts of early humans to identify \u2013 and later cultivate \u2013 plants that were edible, poisonous, and possibly medicinal, making it one of the first endeavours of human investigation. Medieval [[physic garden]]s, often attached to [[Monastery|monasteries]], contained plants possibly having medicinal benefit. They were forerunners of the first [[botanical garden]]s attached to [[University|universities]], founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]]. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of [[plant taxonomy]], and led in 1753 to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system of nomenclature]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]] that remains in use to this day for the naming of all biological species.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of [[optical microscope|optical microscopy]] and [[live cell imaging]], [[electron microscopy]], analysis of [[ploidy|chromosome number]], [[phytochemistry|plant chemistry]] and the structure and function of [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of [[molecular biology|molecular genetic analysis]], including [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] and [[DNA sequences]] to classify plants more accurately.\n\nModern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with contributions and insights from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]] and differentiation, [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]], [[plant physiology#Biochemistry of plants|biochemistry]] and [[metabolism|primary metabolism]], chemical products, [[Plant morphology#Morphology in development|development]], [[plant pathology|diseases]], [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|plant taxonomy]]. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are [[molecular genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], which study the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of [[plant cell]]s and [[Tissue (biology)#Plant tissue|tissues]]. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing [[staple foods]], materials such as [[Lumber|timber]], [[oil]], rubber, [[Fiber|fibre]] and drugs, in modern [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], [[plant propagation]], [[Plant breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic modification]], in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in [[environmental management]], and the maintenance of [[biodiversity]].\n\n"}, {"title": " History ", "content": "{{Main|History of botany}}\n\n=== Early botany ===\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|alt=engraving of cork cells from Hooke's Micrographia, 1665|An engraving of the cells of [[Cork oak|cork]], from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 275\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Renaissance C14 F\u00fcllmaurer Leonhart Fuchs.jpg\n | width1            = 700\n | height1           = 828\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Leonhart Fuchs]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Brunfels-1.png\n | width2            = 700\n | height2           = 828\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Otto Brunfels]]\n<!--image 3-->\n | image3            = Hieronymus Bock (1546).jpg\n | width3            = 700\n | height3           = 828\n | alt3              =\n | link3             =\n | caption3          = [[Hieronymus Bock]]\n}}\n\nBotany originated as [[herbalism]], the study and use of plants for their [[Medicinal plants|possible medicinal properties]].{{sfn|Sumner|2000|p = 16}} The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BCE,{{sfn|Reed|1942|pp = 7\u201329}}{{sfn|Oberlies|1998|p = 155}} [[Ancient Egypt]],{{sfn|Manniche|2006}} in archaic [[Avestan language|Avestan]] writings, and in works from China purportedly from before 221 BCE.{{sfn|Reed|1942|pp = 7\u201329}}{{sfn|Needham|Lu|Huang|1986}}\n\nModern botany traces its roots back to [[Ancient Greece]] specifically to [[Theophrastus]] ({{circa|371}}\u2013287 BCE), a student of [[Aristotle]] who invented and described many of its principles and is widely regarded in the [[scientific community]] as the \"Father of Botany\".{{sfn|Greene|1909|pp = 140\u2013142}} His major works, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' and ''On the Causes of Plants'', constitute the most important contributions to botanical science until the [[Middle Ages]], almost seventeen centuries later.{{sfn|Greene|1909|pp = 140\u2013142}}{{sfn|Bennett|Hammond|1902|p = 30}}\n\nAnother work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is {{Lang|la|[[De materia medica]]}}, a five-volume encyclopedia about [[Herbalism|preliminary herbal medicine]] written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]. {{Lang|la|De materia medica}} was widely read for more than 1,500 years.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|p = 532}} Important contributions from the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Muslim world]] include [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''[[Nabatean Agriculture]]'', [[Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa D\u012bnawar\u012b]]'s (828\u2013896) the ''Book of Plants'', and [[Ibn Bassal]]'s ''The Classification of Soils''. In the early 13th century, [[Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati]], and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.{{sfn|Dallal|2010|p = 197}}{{sfn|Panaino|2002|p = 93}}{{sfn|Levey|1973|p = 116}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, [[botanical garden]]s were founded in a number of Italian universities. The [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]] in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier \"physic gardens\", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for suspected medicinal uses. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] in 1621.{{sfn|Hill|1915}}\n\nGerman physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501\u20131566) was one of \"the three German fathers of botany\", along with theologian [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489\u20131534) and physician [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498\u20131554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).{{sfn|National Museum of Wales|2007}}{{sfn|Yaniv|Bachrach|2005|p = 157}} Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.\n\nPhysician [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515\u20131544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal ''Historia Plantarum'' in 1544 and a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|Sprague|1939}} Naturalist [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516\u20131565) and herbalist [[John Gerard]] (1545\u2013{{circa|1611}}) published herbals covering the supposed medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522\u20131605) was considered the ''father of natural history'', which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}}\n\n=== Early modern botany ===\n{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)#History of taxonomy}}\n[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a garden|The [[Linnaean Garden]] of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted according to his ''Systema sexuale''.]]\n\nDuring the 18th century, systems of [[plant identification]] were developed comparable to [[single access key|dichotomous keys]], where unidentified plants are placed into [[taxon]]omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of [[Character (biology)|characters]]. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ([[single access key#Diagnostic ('artificial') versus synoptic ('natural') keys|diagnostic keys]]) or more closely related to the natural or [[taxonomic order|phyletic order]] of the [[taxon|taxa]] in synoptic keys.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp = 73\u2013117}} By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus]] published his [[Species Plantarum]], a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|modern botanical nomenclature]]. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the [[genus]] and the second identified the [[species]] within the genus.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 220\u2013223}} For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's ''Systema Sexuale'' [[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification of plants|classified]] plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p = 9}}\n\nIncreasing knowledge of [[plant anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. [[Michel Adanson|Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The [[Candollean system]] reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later [[Bentham & Hooker system]], which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s publication of the ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.{{sfn|Starr|2009|pp =299\u2013}}\n\nBotany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first \"modern\" textbook, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundz\u00fcge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 377}}  Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the [[cell theory]] with [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] and was among the first to grasp the significance of the [[cell nucleus]] that had been described by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.{{sfn|Harris|2000|pp = 76\u201381}} In 1855, [[Adolf Fick]] formulated [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's laws]] that enabled the calculation of the rates of [[molecular diffusion]] in biological systems.{{sfn|Small|2012|pp =118\u2013}}\n\n[[File:Echeveria glauca II.jpg|thumb|''Echeveria glauca'' in a Connecticut greenhouse.

No other cells can pass on inherited characters.{{sfn|Karp|2009|p = 382}} The work of [[Katherine Esau]] (1898\u20131997) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany. Her books ''Plant Anatomy'' and ''Anatomy of Seed Plants'' have been key plant structural biology texts for more than half a century.{{sfn|National Science Foundation|1989}}{{sfn|Chaffey|2007|pp = 481\u2013482}}\n\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Kurs in Alpenbotanik-Ans 08784-01-031.tif|left|thumb|upright|Class of alpine botany in Switzerland, 1936]]\n\nThe discipline of [[plant ecology]] was pioneered in the late 19th century by botanists such as [[Eugenius Warming]], who produced the hypothesis that plants form [[plant community|communities]], and his mentor and successor [[Christen C. Raunki\u00e6r]] whose system for describing [[Raunki\u00e6r plant life-form|plant life forms]] is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]] changes by a process of [[ecological succession]] was developed by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]], [[Arthur Tansley]] and [[Frederic Clements]]. Clements is credited with the idea of [[climax vegetation]] as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of [[ecosystem]]s to biology.{{sfn|Tansley|1935|pp=299\u2013302}}{{sfn|Willis|1997|pp=267\u2013271}}{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 457}} Building on the extensive earlier work of [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle|Alphonse de Candolle]], [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov|Nikolai Vavilov]] (1887\u20131943) produced accounts of the [[biogeography]], [[Center of origin|centres of origin]], and evolutionary history of economic plants.{{sfn|de Candolle|2006|pp = 9\u201325, 450\u2013465}}\n\nParticularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of [[Plant physiology|plant physiological]] processes such as [[transpiration]] (the transport of water within plant tissues),  the temperature dependence of rates of water [[evaporation]] from the leaf surface and the [[molecular diffusion]] of water vapour and carbon dioxide through [[stomatal]] apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, and the rate of [[photosynthesis]] have enabled precise description of the rates of [[gas exchange]] between plants and the atmosphere.{{sfn|Jasechko|Sharp|Gibson|Birks|2013|pp = 347\u2013350}}{{sfn|Nobel|1983|p = 608}} Innovations in [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] by [[Ronald Fisher]],{{sfn|Yates|Mather|1963|pp = 91\u2013129}} [[Frank Yates]] and others at [[Rothamsted Research#Statistical science|Rothamsted Experimental Station]] facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research.{{sfn|Finney|1995|pp = 554\u2013573}} The discovery and identification of the [[auxin]] plant hormones by [[Kenneth V.

This beneficial effect is also known as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Once outcrossing is established, subsequent switching to inbreeding becomes disadvantageous since it allows expression of the previously masked deleterious recessive mutations, commonly referred to as inbreeding depression.  \n\nUnlike in higher animals, where [[parthenogenesis]] is rare, [[asexual reproduction]] may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem [[tuber]]s in potato is one example. Particularly in [[arctic]] or [[alpine climate|alpine]] habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers [[zoophily|by animals]] are rare, plantlets or [[bulbs]], may develop instead of flowers, replacing [[sexual reproduction]] with asexual reproduction and giving rise to [[cloning|clonal populations]] genetically identical to the parent.

Apomixis can also happen in a [[seed]], producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.{{sfn|Savidan|2000|pp = 13\u201386}}\n\nMost sexually reproducing organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their [[chromosome number]] may occur due to errors in [[cytokinesis]]. This can occur early in development to produce an [[autopolyploid]] or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid ([[endopolyploidy]]), or during gamete formation. An [[allopolyploid]] plant may result from a [[hybridization event|hybridisation event]] between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are [[reproductively isolated]] from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new [[sympatric speciation|species]].{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce [[vegetative propagation|vegetatively]] or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} [[Durum]] wheat is a fertile [[tetraploid]] allopolyploid, while [[common wheat|bread wheat]] is a fertile [[hexaploid]].

Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as [[genus|genera]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]] \u2013 grouping organisms by ancestry rather than [[phenotype|superficial characteristics]]. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) and administered by the [[International Botanical Congress]].{{sfn|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2011|p = Preamble, para. 7}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}}\n\nKingdom [[Plant]]ae belongs to [[Domain (biology)|Domain]] [[Eukaryota]] and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]] (or Division); [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]] (plural ''genera''); [[Species]]. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}} For example, the tiger lily is ''[[Lilium columbianum]]''. ''Lilium'' is the genus, and ''columbianum'' the [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]]. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013555}}{{sfn|International Association for Plant Taxonomy|2006}}{{sfn|Silyn-Roberts|2000|p = 198}}\n\nThe evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]]. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 438\u2013444}} As an example, species of ''[[Pereskia]]'' are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless [[cactus]] such as an ''[[Echinocactus]]''. However, both ''Pereskia'' and ''Echinocactus'' have spines produced from [[areoles]] (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 446\u2013449}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp = 26\u201327}}\n\n{{Multiple image|float=right\n|title=Two cacti of very different appearance\n|total_width=400\n|width1=3872|height1=2592|image1=Pereskia aculeata5.jpg|caption1=''Pereskia aculeata''\n|width2=4288|height2=3216|image2=Bogarub-echinocactus-grusonii-1.jpg|caption2=''Echinocactus grusonii''\n|footer=Although ''Pereskia'' is a tree with leaves, it has spines and areoles like a more typical cactus, such as ''Echinocactus''.}}\nJudging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through [[convergent evolution]] in which characters have arisen independently. Some [[euphorbia]]s have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The [[Cladistics|cladistic method]] takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history \u2013 such as those evolved separately in different groups ([[homoplasies]]) or those left over from ancestors ([[plesiomorphies]]) \u2013 and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ([[apomorphies]]). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as [[cladogram]]s: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 442\u2013450}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses molecular characters, particularly [[DNA]] sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. [[Clive A. Stace|Clive Stace]] describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\"{{sfn|Stace|2010a|p = 104}} As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below \u2013 fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|p = 453}}\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px; \">{{clade\n|1={{clade\n   |1='''plants'''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1='''fungi'''\n      |2='''animals'''\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n</div>\n\nIn 1998, the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] published a [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of [[angiosperms]], have now been answered.{{sfn|Burger|2013}} Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2003|pp = 399\u2013436}} Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various [[Taxon|taxa]].{{sfn|Capon|2005|p = 223}} Technological developments such as computers and [[electron microscope]]s have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.{{sfn|Morton|1981|pp = 459\u2013459}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n"}, {"title": " Symbols ", "content": "A few symbols are in current use in botany.
