It is a multidisciplinary practice, involving programming, design, art, audio, user interface, and writing. Each of those may be made up of more specialized skills; art includes 3D modeling of objects, character modeling, animation, visual effects, and so on. Development is supported by project management, production, and quality assurance. Teams can be many hundreds of people, a small group, or even a single person.\n\nDevelopment of commercial video games is normally funded by a [[video game publisher|publisher]] and can take two to five years to reach completion. Game creation by small, self-funded teams is called [[indie game|independent development]]. The technology in a game may be written from scratch or use proprietary software specific to one company. As development has become more complex, it has become common for companies and independent developers alike to use off-the-shelf \"engines\" such as [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] or [[Unreal Engine]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-20|title=The Two Engines Driving the $120B Gaming Industry Forward|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research/game-engines-growth-expert-intelligence/|access-date=2020-06-03|website=CB Insights Research|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nCommercial game development began in the 1970s with the advent of [[arcade video game]]s, [[First generation of video game consoles|first-generation video game consoles]] like the [[Atari 2600]], and [[home computer]]s like the [[Apple II]]. Into the 1980s, a lone [[game programmer|programmer]] could develop a full and complete game such as ''[[Pitfall!]]''. By the second and third generation of video game consoles in the late 1980s, the growing popularity of 3D graphics on personal computers, and higher expectations for visuals and quality, it became difficult for a single person to produce a mainstream video game. The average cost of producing a high-end (often called [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA]]) game slowly rose from {{usd}}1\u20134&nbsp;million in 2000, to over $200 million and up by 2023. At the same time, independent game development has flourished. The best-selling video game of all time, ''[[Minecraft]]'', was initially written by one person, then supported by a small team, before the company was acquired by [[Microsoft]] and greatly expanded.\n\nMainstream commercial video games are generally developed in phases. A concept is developed which then moves to [[pre-production]] where [[prototype]]s are written and the plan for the entire game is created. This is followed by full-scale development or ''production'', then sometimes a post-production period where the game is polished. It has become common for many developers, especially smaller developers, to publicly release games in an \"early access\" form, where iterative development takes place in tandem with feedback from actual players.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nGames are produced through the [[software development]] process. {{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=4}} Games are developed as a creative outlet{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=7}} and to

It may also include preliminary sketches of various aspects of the game. The design document is sometimes accompanied by functional [[Software prototyping|prototypes]] of some sections of the game.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The design document remains a [[living document]] throughout the development\u2014often changed weekly or even daily.{{sfn|Oxland|2004|p=241}}\n\nCompiling a list of game's needs is called \"requirement capture\".{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=3}}\n\n==== Prototype ====\n[[File:Battle for Mandicor 0.0.5.png|thumb|Placeholder graphics are characteristic of early game prototypes.]]\n\nWriting [[Software prototyping|prototype]]s of gameplay ideas and features is an important activity that allows programmers and game designers to experiment with different [[algorithm]]s and usability scenarios for a game. A great deal of prototyping may take place during [[pre-production]] before the design document is complete and may, in fact, help determine what features the design specifies. Prototyping at this stage is often done manually, (paper prototyping), not digitally,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} as this is often easier and faster to test and make changes before wasting time and resources into what could be a canceled idea or project. Prototyping may also take place during active development to test new ideas as the game emerges.\n\nPrototypes are often meant only to act as a [[proof of concept]] or to test ideas, by adding, modifying or removing some of the features.{{sfn|Brathwaite|Schreiber|2009|p=189}} Most algorithms and features debuted in a prototype may be [[Porting|ported]] to the game once they have been completed.\n\nOften prototypes need to be developed quickly with very little time for up-front design (around 15 to 20 minutes of testing).{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Therefore, usually very prolific programmers are called upon to quickly code these [[testbed]] tools. [[Rapid application development|RAD]] tools may be used to aid in the quick development of these programs. In case the prototype is in a physical form, programmers and designers alike will make the game with paper, dice, and other easy to access tools in order to make the prototype faster.\n\nA successful development model is [[Iterative design|iterative prototyping]], where design is refined based on current progress. There are various technology available for video game development{{sfn|Bates|2004|p=226}}\n\n=== Production ===\n\nProduction is the main stage of development, when assets and [[source code]] for the game are produced.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=9}}\n\nMainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the project is fully staffed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Programmers write new [[source code]], artists develop [[game asset]]s, such as, [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] or [[3D model]]s. Sound engineers develop sound effects and composers develop music for the game. [[Level designer]]s create levels, and writers write dialogue for cutscenes and [[non-player character|NPCs]].{{Original research inline|reason=a bit or'ish if you ask me; need to cite individual tasks or write overview from below section|date=April 2010}}  Game designers continue to develop the game's design throughout production.\n\n==== Design ====\n{{Main|Game design}}\n\nGame design is an essential and collaborative{{sfn|Bates|2004|p=xxi}} process of designing the content and rules of a [[game]],{{sfn|Brathwaite|Schreiber|2009|p=2}} requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills.{{sfn|Adams|Rollings|2006|pp=20, 22\u201323, 24\u201325}} Creativity and an open mind is vital for the completion of a successful video game.\n\nDuring development, the game designer implements and modifies the game design to reflect the current vision of the game. Features and levels are often removed or added. The art treatment may evolve and the backstory may change. A new [[computing platform|platform]] may be targeted as well as a new [[demographic]]. All these changes need to be documented and disseminated to the rest of the team. Most changes occur as updates to the design document.\n\n==== Programming ====\n{{Main|Game programming}}\n\nThe programming of the game is handled by one or more [[game programmer]]s. They develop prototypes to test ideas, many of which may never make it into the final game.  The programmers incorporate new features demanded by the game design and fix any bugs introduced during the development process. Even if an off-the-shelf [[game engine]] is used, a great deal of programming is required to customize almost every game.\n\n==== Level creation ====\n{{Main|Level design}}\n\nFrom a time standpoint, the game's first level takes the longest to develop. As level designers and artists use the tools for level building, they request features and changes to the in-house tools that allow for quicker and higher quality development. Newly introduced features may cause old levels to become obsolete, so the levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed and discarded. Because of the dynamic environment of game development, the design of early levels may also change over time. It is not uncommon to spend upwards of twelve months on one level of a game developed over the course of three years. Later levels can be developed much more quickly as the feature set is more complete and the game vision is clearer and more stable.\n\n==== Art production ====\n{{Main|Game art design}}\n\nDuring development, artists make art assets according to specifications given by the designers. Early in production, concept artists make concept art to guide the artistic direction of the game, rough art is made for prototypes, and the designers work with artists to design the visual style and visual language of the game. As production goes on, more final art is made, and existing art is edited based on player feedback.\n\n==== Audio production ====\n{{Further|Video game music}}\n\nGame audio may be separated into three categories\u2014sound effects, music, and voice-over.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=49}}\n\nSound effect production is the production of sounds by either tweaking a sample to a desired effect or replicating it with real objects.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=49}} Sound effects include UI sound design, which effectively conveys information both for visible UI elements and as an auditory display. It provides sonic feedback for in-game interfaces, as well as contributing to the overall game aesthetic.<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttps://www.asoundeffect.com/sci-fi-ui-sound-effects/\n|title=How To Design Superb Sci-Fi UI Sound Effects|date=22 March 2017 |access-date=January 6, 2022|archive-date=March 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210315164614/https://www.asoundeffect.com/sci-fi-ui-sound-effects/|url-status=live}}</ref> Sound effects are important and impact the game's delivery.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=363}}\n\nMusic may be synthesized or performed live.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=50}}\n\nThere are four main ways in which music is presented in a game.\n\n* Music may be ambient, especially for slow periods of game, where the music aims to reinforce the aesthetic mood and game setting.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=344}}\n* Music may be triggered by in-game events. For example, in such games as [[Pac-Man]] or [[Mario]], player picking up [[power-up]]s triggered respective musical scores.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=344}}\n* Action music, such as chase, battle or hunting sequences is fast-paced, hard-changing score.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=345}}\n* Menu music, similar to credits music, creates aural impact while relatively little action is taking place.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=345}}\n\nA game title with 20 hours of single-player gameplay may feature around 1 hour.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=345}}\n\n==== Testing ====\n{{Main|Game testing}}\n\n[[Quality assurance]] of a video game product plays a significant role throughout the development cycle of a game, though comes more significantly into play as the game nears completion. Unlike other software products or productivity applications, video games are fundamentally meant to entertain, and thus the testing of video games is more focused on the end-user experience rather than the accuracy of the software code's performance, which leads to differences in how game software is developed.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\">{{cite arXiv | last1 = Politowski | first1= Cristiano | first2= Fabio |last2= Petrillo | first3= Yann-G\u00e4el |last3 = Gu\u00e9h\u00e9neuc | title = A Survey of Video Game Testing | eprint=2103.06431  | date = 2021 | class= cs.SE }}</ref>\n\nBecause game development is focused on the presentation and gameplay as seen by the player, there often is little rigor in maintaining and testing backend code in early stages of development since such code may be readily disregarded if there are changes found in gameplay. Some [[Test automation|automated testing]] may be used to assure the core game engine operates as expected, but most game testing comes via [[game tester]], who enter the testing process once a playable prototype is available. This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> The use of testers may be lightweight at the early stages of development, but the testers' role becomes more predominant as the game nears completion, becoming a full-time role alongside development.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Early testing is considered a key part of game design; the most common issue raised in several published post-mortems on game development was the failure to start the testing process early.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nAs code matures and the gameplay features solidify, then development typically includes more rigorous test controls such as [[regression testing]] to make sure new updates to the code base do not change working parts of the game. Games are complex software systems, and changes in one code area may unexpected cause a seemingly unrelated part of the game to fail. Testers are tasked to repeatedly play through updated versions of games in these later stages to look for any issues or bugs not otherwise found from automated testing. Because this can be a monotonous task of playing the same game over and over, this process can lead to games frequently being released with uncaught bugs or glitches.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nThere are other factors simply inherent to video games that can make testing difficult. This includes the use of randomized gameplay systems, which require more testing for both game balance and bug tracking than more linearized games, the balance of cost and time to devote to testing as part of the development budget, and assuring that the game still remains fun and entertaining to play as changes are made to it.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nDespite the dangers of overlooking regression testing, some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs. This can result in customers dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals. When this does happen, most developers and publishers quickly release [[Patch (computing)|patches]] that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Certain publishing models are designed specifically to accommodate the fact that first releases of games may be bug-ridden but will be fixed post-release. The [[early access]] model invites players to pay into a game before its planned release and help to provide feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> [[Mobile games]] and games with live services are also anticipated to be updated on a frequent basis, offset pre-release testing with live feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/>\n\n=== Milestones ===\n[[File:Software_dev2.svg|thumb|right|200px|Video game development milestones follow a similar process as with other software development.]]\n\nCommercial game development projects may be required to meet milestones set by publisher.<!--244--> Milestones mark major events during game development and are used to track game's progress.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}} Such milestones may be, for example, ''first playable'',{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244\u2013245}} ''alpha'',{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} or ''beta''{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}  game versions.<!--The refs mention these being milestones, not just mention versions.--> Project milestones depend on the developer schedules.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}}\n\nMilestones are usually based on multiple short descriptions for functionality; examples may be \"Player roaming around in game environment\" or \"Physics working, collisions, vehicle\" etc. (numerous descriptions are possible).  These milestones are usually how the developer gets paid; sometimes as \"an advance against royalty\". These milestones are listed, anywhere from three to twenty depending on developer and publisher.  The milestone list is usually a collaborative agreement between the publisher and developer.  The developer usually advocates for making the milestone descriptions as simple as possible; depending on the specific publisher - the milestone agreements may get very detailed for a specific game.  When working with a good publisher, the \"spirit of the law\" is usually adhered to regarding milestone completion... in other words if the milestone is 90% complete the milestone is usually paid with the understanding that it will be 100% complete by the next due milestone.  It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer, and usually (but not always) the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met.  Also, sometimes milestones are \"swapped\", the developer or publisher may mutually agree to amend the agreement and rearrange milestone goals depending on changing requirements and development resources available.  Milestone agreements are usually included as part of the legal development contracts.  After each \"milestone\" there is usually a payment arrangement.  Some very established developers may simply have a milestone agreement based on the amount of time the game is in development (monthly / quarterly) and not specific game functionality - this is not as common as detailed functionality \"milestone lists\".\n\nThere is no industry standard for defining milestones, and such vary depending on publisher, year, or project.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=192}} Some common milestones for two-year development cycle are as follows:{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}}\n\n==== First playable ====\n\nThe ''first playable'' is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets,{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}} this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}} It is often based on the prototype created in pre-production.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244\u2013245}} Alpha and first playable are sometimes used to refer to a single milestone, however large projects require first playable before [[feature complete]] alpha.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}} First playable occurs 12 to 18 months before code release.  It is sometimes referred to as the \"Pre-Alpha\" stage.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Alpha ====\n{{See also|Alpha release}}\n\n''Alpha'' is the stage when key gameplay functionality is implemented, and assets are partially finished.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} A game in alpha is ''feature complete'', that is, game is playable and contains all the major features.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=192}} These features may be further revised based on testing and feedback.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} Additional small, new features may be added, similarly planned, but unimplemented features may be dropped.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=192}} Programmers focus mainly on finishing the codebase, rather than implementing additions.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}}\n\n==== Code freeze ====\n\n''Code freeze'' is the stage when new code is no longer added to the game and only bugs are being corrected.<!--245--> Code freeze occurs three to four months before code release.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Beta ====\n{{See also|Beta release}}\n\n''Beta'' is feature and asset complete version of the game, when only bugs are being fixed.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} This version contains no bugs that prevent the game from being shippable.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}} No changes are made to the game features, assets, or code.<!--245--> Beta occurs two to three months before code release.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Code release ====\n\n''Code release'' is the stage when many bugs are fixed and game is ready to be shipped or submitted for console manufacturer review.<!--245--> This version is tested against QA test plan.<!--245--> First code release candidate is usually ready three to four weeks before code release.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Gold master ====\n{{See also|Release to manufacturing}}\n\n''Gold master'' is the final game's build that is used as a master for production of the game.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=295}}\n\n==== Release schedules and \"crunch time\" ====\n{{see also|Crunch (video games)}}\nIn most [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA]] game development, games are announced a year or more in advance and given a planned release date or approximate window so that they can promote and market the game, establish orders with retailers, and entice consumers to pre-order the game. Delaying the release of a video game can have negative financial impact for publishers and developers, and extensive delays may lead to project cancellation and employee layoffs.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=20,48}} To assure a game makes a set release date, publishers and developers may require their employees to work overtime to complete the game, which is considered common in the industry.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=241}} This overtime is often referred to it as \"[[Crunch (video games)|crunch time]]\" or \"crunch mode\".{{sfn|McShaffry|2009|p=17}} In 2004 and afterwards, the culture of crunch time in the industry came under scrutiny, leading to many publishers and developers to reduce the expectation on developers for overtime work and better schedule management, though crunch time still can occur.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=48, 241}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\n\nAfter the game [[Release to manufacturing|goes gold]] and ships, some developers will give team members ''comp time'' (perhaps up to a week or two) to compensate for the overtime put in to complete the game, though this compensation is not standard.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\n==== Maintenance ====\nOnce a game ships, the maintenance phase for the video game begins.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=97}}\n\nGames developed for [[video game console]]s have had almost no maintenance period in the past. The shipped game would forever house as many bugs and features as when released. This was common for consoles since all consoles had identical or nearly identical hardware; making incompatibility, the cause of many bugs, a non-issue. In this case, maintenance would only occur in the case of a [[Game port|port]], [[sequel]], or [[enhanced remake]] that reuses a large portion of the engine and assets.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\nIn recent times popularity of online console games has grown, and online capable video game consoles and online services such as [[Xbox Live]] for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] have developed. Developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches. These changes would not have been possible in the past without the widespread availability of the [[Internet]].{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\n[[IBM PC compatible|PC]] development is different. Game developers try to account for majority of configurations and hardware. However, the number of possible configurations of hardware and software inevitably leads to discovery of game-breaking circumstances that the programmers and testers did not account for.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\nProgrammers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible. Once the developer thinks they've obtained enough feedback, the programmers start working on a [[patch (computing)|patch]]. The patch may take weeks or months to develop, but it is intended to fix most accounted bugs and problems with the game that were overlooked past code release, or in rare cases, fix unintended problems caused by previous patches. Occasionally a patch may include extra features or content or may even alter gameplay.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\nIn the case of a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOG), such as a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] or [[MMORTS]], the shipment of the game is the starting phase of maintenance.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=97}}  The maintenance staff for such an online game can number in the dozens, sometimes including members of the original programming team,{{Cn|date=January 2021}} as the game world is continuously changed and iterated and new features are added. Some developers implement a public test realm or player test realm (PTR) in order to test out significant upcoming changes prior to release.

For that region, the developers may want to translate the game to make it more accessible. For example, some games created for [[PlayStation Vita]] were initially published in Japanese language, like ''[[Soul Sacrifice (video game)|Soul Sacrifice]]''. Non-native speakers of the game's original language may have to wait for the translation of the game to their language. But most modern big-budget games take localization into account during the development process and the games are released in several different languages simultaneously.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Modesto |first1=Cristian |title=Insights on Game Localization From Ark One Studios |url=https://80.lv/articles/insights-on-game-localization-from-ark-one-studios/ |website=80.lv |date=14 June 2023 |access-date=27 July 2023}}</ref>\n\nLocalization is the process of translating the language assets in a game into other languages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584503432/bytelevelrese-20|title=The Game Localization Handbook|publisher=Charles River Media|author=Chandler, H.|date=October 2004|isbn=978-1584503439}}</ref> By localizing games, they increase their level of accessibility where games could help to expend the international markets effectively. Game localization is generally known as language translations yet a \"full localization\" of a game is a complex project. Different levels of translation range from: zero translation being that there is no translation to the product and all things are sent raw, basic translation where only a few text and subtitles are translated or even added, and a full translation where new voice overs and game material changes are added.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\nThere are various essential elements on localizing a game including translating the language of the game to adjusting in-game assets for different cultures to reach more potential consumers in other geographies (or globalization for short). Translation seems to fall into the scope of localization, which itself constitutes a substantially broader endeavor.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Explorations: A Journal of Language and Literature|author=Czech, D.|year=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3\u201325|url=https://www.academia.edu/6639017|title=Challenges in video game localization: An integrated perspective}}</ref> These include the different levels of translation to the globalization of the game itself. However, certain developers seem to be divided on whether globalization falls under localization or not.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\nMoreover, in order to fit into the local markets, game production companies often change or redesign the graphic designs or the packaging of the game for marketing purposes. For example, the popular game ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' has two different packaging designs for the European and US market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/13/how-game-art-changes-around-the-world?page=1|title=How Game Art Changes Around the World|date=March 13, 2012|work=IGN|first = Lucas M.|last = Thomas}}</ref> By localizing the graphics and packaging designs, companies might arouse better connections and attention from the consumers from various regions.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\n== Development costs ==\n{{seealso|List of most expensive video games to develop}}\nThe costs of developing a video game varies widely depending on several factors including team size, game genre and scope, and other factors such as intellectual property licensing costs.

It is a multidisciplinary practice, involving programming, design, art, audio, user interface, and writing. Each of those may be made up of more specialized skills; art includes 3D modeling of objects, character modeling, animation, visual effects, and so on. Development is supported by project management, production, and quality assurance. Teams can be many hundreds of people, a small group, or even a single person.\n\nDevelopment of commercial video games is normally funded by a [[video game publisher|publisher]] and can take two to five years to reach completion. Game creation by small, self-funded teams is called [[indie game|independent development]]. The technology in a game may be written from scratch or use proprietary software specific to one company. As development has become more complex, it has become common for companies and independent developers alike to use off-the-shelf \"engines\" such as [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] or [[Unreal Engine]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-20|title=The Two Engines Driving the $120B Gaming Industry Forward|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research/game-engines-growth-expert-intelligence/|access-date=2020-06-03|website=CB Insights Research|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nCommercial game development began in the 1970s with the advent of [[arcade video game]]s, [[First generation of video game consoles|first-generation video game consoles]] like the [[Atari 2600]], and [[home computer]]s like the [[Apple II]]. Into the 1980s, a lone [[game programmer|programmer]] could develop a full and complete game such as ''[[Pitfall!]]''. By the second and third generation of video game consoles in the late 1980s, the growing popularity of 3D graphics on personal computers, and higher expectations for visuals and quality, it became difficult for a single person to produce a mainstream video game. The average cost of producing a high-end (often called [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA]]) game slowly rose from {{usd}}1\u20134&nbsp;million in 2000, to over $200 million and up by 2023. At the same time, independent game development has flourished. The best-selling video game of all time, ''[[Minecraft]]'', was initially written by one person, then supported by a small team, before the company was acquired by [[Microsoft]] and greatly expanded.\n\nMainstream commercial video games are generally developed in phases. A concept is developed which then moves to [[pre-production]] where [[prototype]]s are written and the plan for the entire game is created. This is followed by full-scale development or ''production'', then sometimes a post-production period where the game is polished. It has become common for many developers, especially smaller developers, to publicly release games in an \"early access\" form, where iterative development takes place in tandem with feedback from actual players.\n\n"}, {"title": " Overview ", "content": "\nGames are produced through the [[software development]] process. {{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=4}} Games are developed as a creative

As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising.\n\nThey usually finance the development, sometimes by paying a video game developer (the publisher calls this external development) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio. Consequently, they also typically own the IP of the game.<ref name=MGA_SoA /> Large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish.\n\nOther functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any license that the game may utilize; paying for localization; layout, printing, and possibly the writing of the user manual; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design.\n\nLarge publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-10-05 |title=Understanding video game developers as an occupational community |url=https://www.datasakura.com/works-games |website=Gamering}}</ref>\n\nBecause the publisher usually finances development, it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer, critique ongoing development, and assist as necessary. Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties.

It may also include preliminary sketches of various aspects of the game. The design document is sometimes accompanied by functional [[Software prototyping|prototypes]] of some sections of the game.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The design document remains a [[living document]] throughout the development\u2014often changed weekly or even daily.{{sfn|Oxland|2004|p=241}}\n\nCompiling a list of game's needs is called \"requirement capture\".{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=3}}\n\n==== Prototype ====\n[[File:Battle for Mandicor 0.0.5.png|thumb|Placeholder graphics are characteristic of early game prototypes.]]\n\nWriting [[Software prototyping|prototype]]s of gameplay ideas and features is an important activity that allows programmers and game designers to experiment with different [[algorithm]]s and usability scenarios for a game. A great deal of prototyping may take place during [[pre-production]] before the design document is complete and may, in fact, help determine what features the design specifies. Prototyping at this stage is often done manually, (paper prototyping), not digitally,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} as this is often easier and faster to test and make changes before wasting time and resources into what could be a canceled idea or project. Prototyping may also take place during active development to test new ideas as the game emerges.\n\nPrototypes are often meant only to act as a [[proof of concept]] or to test ideas, by adding, modifying or removing some of the features.{{sfn|Brathwaite|Schreiber|2009|p=189}} Most algorithms and features debuted in a prototype may be [[Porting|ported]] to the game once they have been completed.\n\nOften prototypes need to be developed quickly with very little time for up-front design (around 15 to 20 minutes of testing).{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Therefore, usually very prolific programmers are called upon to quickly code these [[testbed]] tools. [[Rapid application development|RAD]] tools may be used to aid in the quick development of these programs. In case the prototype is in a physical form, programmers and designers alike will make the game with paper, dice, and other easy to access tools in order to make the prototype faster.\n\nA successful development model is [[Iterative design|iterative prototyping]], where design is refined based on current progress. There are various technology available for video game development{{sfn|Bates|2004|p=226}}\n\n=== Production ===\n\nProduction is the main stage of development, when assets and [[source code]] for the game are produced.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=9}}\n\nMainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the project is fully staffed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Programmers write new [[source code]], artists develop [[game asset]]s, such as, [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] or [[3D model]]s. Sound engineers develop sound effects and composers develop music for the game. [[Level designer]]s create levels, and writers write dialogue for cutscenes and [[non-player character|NPCs]].{{Original research inline|reason=a bit or'ish if you ask me; need to cite individual tasks or write overview from below section|date=April 2010}}  Game designers continue to develop the game's design throughout production.\n\n==== Design ====\n{{Main|Game design}}\n\nGame design is an essential and collaborative{{sfn|Bates|2004|p=xxi}} process of designing the content and rules of a [[game]],{{sfn|Brathwaite|Schreiber|2009|p=2}} requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills.{{sfn|Adams|Rollings|2006|pp=20, 22\u201323, 24\u201325}} Creativity and an open mind is vital for the completion of a successful video game.\n\nDuring development, the game designer implements and modifies the game design to reflect the current vision of the game. Features and levels are often removed or added. The art treatment may evolve and the backstory may change. A new [[computing platform|platform]] may be targeted as well as a new [[demographic]]. All these changes need to be documented and disseminated to the rest of the team. Most changes occur as updates to the design document.\n\n==== Programming ====\n{{Main|Game programming}}\n\nThe programming of the game is handled by one or more [[game programmer]]s. They develop prototypes to test ideas, many of which may never make it into the final game.  The programmers incorporate new features demanded by the game design and fix any bugs introduced during the development process. Even if an off-the-shelf [[game engine]] is used, a great deal of programming is required to customize almost every game.\n\n==== Level creation ====\n{{Main|Level design}}\n\nFrom a time standpoint, the game's first level takes the longest to develop. As level designers and artists use the tools for level building, they request features and changes to the in-house tools that allow for quicker and higher quality development. Newly introduced features may cause old levels to become obsolete, so the levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed and discarded. Because of the dynamic environment of game development, the design of early levels may also change over time. It is not uncommon to spend upwards of twelve months on one level of a game developed over the course of three years. Later levels can be developed much more quickly as the feature set is more complete and the game vision is clearer and more stable.\n\n==== Art production ====\n{{Main|Game art design}}\n\nDuring development, artists make art assets according to specifications given by the designers. Early in production, concept artists make concept art to guide the artistic direction of the game, rough art is made for prototypes, and the designers work with artists to design the visual style and visual language of the game. As production goes on, more final art is made, and existing art is edited based on player feedback.\n\n==== Audio production ====\n{{Further|Video game music}}\n\nGame audio may be separated into three categories\u2014sound effects, music, and voice-over.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=49}}\n\nSound effect production is the production of sounds by either tweaking a sample to a desired effect or replicating it with real objects.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=49}} Sound effects include UI sound design, which effectively conveys information both for visible UI elements and as an auditory display. It provides sonic feedback for in-game interfaces, as well as contributing to the overall game aesthetic.<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttps://www.asoundeffect.com/sci-fi-ui-sound-effects/\n|title=How To Design Superb Sci-Fi UI Sound Effects|date=22 March 2017 |access-date=January 6, 2022|archive-date=March 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210315164614/https://www.asoundeffect.com/sci-fi-ui-sound-effects/|url-status=live}}</ref> Sound effects are important and impact the game's delivery.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=363}}\n\nMusic may be synthesized or performed live.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=50}}\n\nThere are four main ways in which music is presented in a game.\n\n* Music may be ambient, especially for slow periods of game, where the music aims to reinforce the aesthetic mood and game setting.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=344}}\n* Music may be triggered by in-game events. For example, in such games as [[Pac-Man]] or [[Mario]], player picking up [[power-up]]s triggered respective musical scores.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=344}}\n* Action music, such as chase, battle or hunting sequences is fast-paced, hard-changing score.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=345}}\n* Menu music, similar to credits music, creates aural impact while relatively little action is taking place.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=345}}\n\nA game title with 20 hours of single-player gameplay may feature around 1 hour.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=345}}\n\n==== Testing ====\n{{Main|Game testing}}\n\n[[Quality assurance]] of a video game product plays a significant role throughout the development cycle of a game, though comes more significantly into play as the game nears completion. Unlike other software products or productivity applications, video games are fundamentally meant to entertain, and thus the testing of video games is more focused on the end-user experience rather than the accuracy of the software code's performance, which leads to differences in how game software is developed.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\">{{cite arXiv | last1 = Politowski | first1= Cristiano | first2= Fabio |last2= Petrillo | first3= Yann-G\u00e4el |last3 = Gu\u00e9h\u00e9neuc | title = A Survey of Video Game Testing | eprint=2103.06431  | date = 2021 | class= cs.SE }}</ref>\n\nBecause game development is focused on the presentation and gameplay as seen by the player, there often is little rigor in maintaining and testing backend code in early stages of development since such code may be readily disregarded if there are changes found in gameplay. Some [[Test automation|automated testing]] may be used to assure the core game engine operates as expected, but most game testing comes via [[game tester]], who enter the testing process once a playable prototype is available. This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> The use of testers may be lightweight at the early stages of development, but the testers' role becomes more predominant as the game nears completion, becoming a full-time role alongside development.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Early testing is considered a key part of game design; the most common issue raised in several published post-mortems on game development was the failure to start the testing process early.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nAs code matures and the gameplay features solidify, then development typically includes more rigorous test controls such as [[regression testing]] to make sure new updates to the code base do not change working parts of the game. Games are complex software systems, and changes in one code area may unexpected cause a seemingly unrelated part of the game to fail. Testers are tasked to repeatedly play through updated versions of games in these later stages to look for any issues or bugs not otherwise found from automated testing. Because this can be a monotonous task of playing the same game over and over, this process can lead to games frequently being released with uncaught bugs or glitches.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nThere are other factors simply inherent to video games that can make testing difficult. This includes the use of randomized gameplay systems, which require more testing for both game balance and bug tracking than more linearized games, the balance of cost and time to devote to testing as part of the development budget, and assuring that the game still remains fun and entertaining to play as changes are made to it.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nDespite the dangers of overlooking regression testing, some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs. This can result in customers dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals. When this does happen, most developers and publishers quickly release [[Patch (computing)|patches]] that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Certain publishing models are designed specifically to accommodate the fact that first releases of games may be bug-ridden but will be fixed post-release. The [[early access]] model invites players to pay into a game before its planned release and help to provide feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> [[Mobile games]] and games with live services are also anticipated to be updated on a frequent basis, offset pre-release testing with live feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/>\n\n=== Milestones ===\n[[File:Software_dev2.svg|thumb|right|200px|Video game development milestones follow a similar process as with other software development.]]\n\nCommercial game development projects may be required to meet milestones set by publisher.<!--244--> Milestones mark major events during game development and are used to track game's progress.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}} Such milestones may be, for example, ''first playable'',{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244\u2013245}} ''alpha'',{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} or ''beta''{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}  game versions.<!--The refs mention these being milestones, not just mention versions.--> Project milestones depend on the developer schedules.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}}\n\nMilestones are usually based on multiple short descriptions for functionality; examples may be \"Player roaming around in game environment\" or \"Physics working, collisions, vehicle\" etc. (numerous descriptions are possible).  These milestones are usually how the developer gets paid; sometimes as \"an advance against royalty\". These milestones are listed, anywhere from three to twenty depending on developer and publisher.  The milestone list is usually a collaborative agreement between the publisher and developer.  The developer usually advocates for making the milestone descriptions as simple as possible; depending on the specific publisher - the milestone agreements may get very detailed for a specific game.  When working with a good publisher, the \"spirit of the law\" is usually adhered to regarding milestone completion... in other words if the milestone is 90% complete the milestone is usually paid with the understanding that it will be 100% complete by the next due milestone.  It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer, and usually (but not always) the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met.  Also, sometimes milestones are \"swapped\", the developer or publisher may mutually agree to amend the agreement and rearrange milestone goals depending on changing requirements and development resources available.  Milestone agreements are usually included as part of the legal development contracts.  After each \"milestone\" there is usually a payment arrangement.  Some very established developers may simply have a milestone agreement based on the amount of time the game is in development (monthly / quarterly) and not specific game functionality - this is not as common as detailed functionality \"milestone lists\".\n\nThere is no industry standard for defining milestones, and such vary depending on publisher, year, or project.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=192}} Some common milestones for two-year development cycle are as follows:{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}}\n\n==== First playable ====\n\nThe ''first playable'' is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets,{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}} this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}} It is often based on the prototype created in pre-production.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244\u2013245}} Alpha and first playable are sometimes used to refer to a single milestone, however large projects require first playable before [[feature complete]] alpha.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}} First playable occurs 12 to 18 months before code release.  It is sometimes referred to as the \"Pre-Alpha\" stage.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Alpha ====\n{{See also|Alpha release}}\n\n''Alpha'' is the stage when key gameplay functionality is implemented, and assets are partially finished.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} A game in alpha is ''feature complete'', that is, game is playable and contains all the major features.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=192}} These features may be further revised based on testing and feedback.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} Additional small, new features may be added, similarly planned, but unimplemented features may be dropped.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=192}} Programmers focus mainly on finishing the codebase, rather than implementing additions.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}}\n\n==== Code freeze ====\n\n''Code freeze'' is the stage when new code is no longer added to the game and only bugs are being corrected.<!--245--> Code freeze occurs three to four months before code release.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Beta ====\n{{See also|Beta release}}\n\n''Beta'' is feature and asset complete version of the game, when only bugs are being fixed.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} This version contains no bugs that prevent the game from being shippable.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}} No changes are made to the game features, assets, or code.<!--245--> Beta occurs two to three months before code release.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Code release ====\n\n''Code release'' is the stage when many bugs are fixed and game is ready to be shipped or submitted for console manufacturer review.<!--245--> This version is tested against QA test plan.<!--245--> First code release candidate is usually ready three to four weeks before code release.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}\n\n==== Gold master ====\n{{See also|Release to manufacturing}}\n\n''Gold master'' is the final game's build that is used as a master for production of the game.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=295}}\n\n==== Release schedules and \"crunch time\" ====\n{{see also|Crunch (video games)}}\nIn most [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA]] game development, games are announced a year or more in advance and given a planned release date or approximate window so that they can promote and market the game, establish orders with retailers, and entice consumers to pre-order the game. Delaying the release of a video game can have negative financial impact for publishers and developers, and extensive delays may lead to project cancellation and employee layoffs.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=20,48}} To assure a game makes a set release date, publishers and developers may require their employees to work overtime to complete the game, which is considered common in the industry.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=241}} This overtime is often referred to it as \"[[Crunch (video games)|crunch time]]\" or \"crunch mode\".{{sfn|McShaffry|2009|p=17}} In 2004 and afterwards, the culture of crunch time in the industry came under scrutiny, leading to many publishers and developers to reduce the expectation on developers for overtime work and better schedule management, though crunch time still can occur.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=48, 241}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\n\nAfter the game [[Release to manufacturing|goes gold]] and ships, some developers will give team members ''comp time'' (perhaps up to a week or two) to compensate for the overtime put in to complete the game, though this compensation is not standard.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\n==== Maintenance ====\nOnce a game ships, the maintenance phase for the video game begins.{{sfn|Moore|Novak|2010|p=97}}\n\nGames developed for [[video game console]]s have had almost no maintenance period in the past. The shipped game would forever house as many bugs and features as when released. This was common for consoles since all consoles had identical or nearly identical hardware; making incompatibility, the cause of many bugs, a non-issue. In this case, maintenance would only occur in the case of a [[Game port|port]], [[sequel]], or [[enhanced remake]] that reuses a large portion of the engine and assets.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\nIn recent times popularity of online console games has grown, and online capable video game consoles and online services such as [[Xbox Live]] for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] have developed. Developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches. These changes would not have been possible in the past without the widespread availability of the [[Internet]].{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\n[[IBM PC compatible|PC]] development is different. Game developers try to account for majority of configurations and hardware. However, the number of possible configurations of hardware and software inevitably leads to discovery of game-breaking circumstances that the programmers and testers did not account for.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}\n\nProgrammers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible. Once the developer thinks they've obtained enough feedback, the programmers start working on a [[patch (computing)|patch]]. The patch may take weeks or months to develop, but it is intended to fix most accounted bugs and problems with the game that were overlooked past code release, or in rare cases, fix unintended problems caused by previous patches.

Unlike other software products or productivity applications, video games are fundamentally meant to entertain, and thus the testing of video games is more focused on the end-user experience rather than the accuracy of the software code's performance, which leads to differences in how game software is developed.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\">{{cite arXiv | last1 = Politowski | first1= Cristiano | first2= Fabio |last2= Petrillo | first3= Yann-G\u00e4el |last3 = Gu\u00e9h\u00e9neuc | title = A Survey of Video Game Testing | eprint=2103.06431  | date = 2021 | class= cs.SE }}</ref>\n\nBecause game development is focused on the presentation and gameplay as seen by the player, there often is little rigor in maintaining and testing backend code in early stages of development since such code may be readily disregarded if there are changes found in gameplay. Some [[Test automation|automated testing]] may be used to assure the core game engine operates as expected, but most game testing comes via [[game tester]], who enter the testing process once a playable prototype is available. This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> The use of testers may be lightweight at the early stages of development, but the testers' role becomes more predominant as the game nears completion, becoming a full-time role alongside development.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Early testing is considered a key part of game design; the most common issue raised in several published post-mortems on game development was the failure to start the testing process early.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nAs code matures and the gameplay features solidify, then development typically includes more rigorous test controls such as [[regression testing]] to make sure new updates to the code base do not change working parts of the game. Games are complex software systems, and changes in one code area may unexpected cause a seemingly unrelated part of the game to fail. Testers are tasked to repeatedly play through updated versions of games in these later stages to look for any issues or bugs not otherwise found from automated testing. Because this can be a monotonous task of playing the same game over and over, this process can lead to games frequently being released with uncaught bugs or glitches.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nThere are other factors simply inherent to video games that can make testing difficult. This includes the use of randomized gameplay systems, which require more testing for both game balance and bug tracking than more linearized games, the balance of cost and time to devote to testing as part of the development budget, and assuring that the game still remains fun and entertaining to play as changes are made to it.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nDespite the dangers of overlooking regression testing, some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs. This can result in customers dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals. When this does happen, most developers and publishers quickly release [[Patch (computing)|patches]] that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Certain publishing models are designed specifically to accommodate the fact that first releases of games may be bug-ridden but will be fixed post-release. The [[early access]] model invites players to pay into a game before its planned release and help to provide feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> [[Mobile games]] and games with live services are also anticipated to be updated on a frequent basis, offset pre-release testing with live feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/>\n\n"}, {"title": " Design ", "content": "{{Main|Game design}}\n\nGame design is an essential and collaborative{{sfn|Bates|2004|p=xxi}} process of designing the content and rules of a [[game]],{{sfn|Brathwaite|Schreiber|2009|p=2}} requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills.{{sfn|Adams|Rollings|2006|pp=20, 22\u201323, 24\u201325}} Creativity and an open mind is vital for the completion of a successful video game.\n\nDuring development, the game designer implements and modifies the game design to reflect the current vision of the game.

Unlike other software products or productivity applications, video games are fundamentally meant to entertain, and thus the testing of video games is more focused on the end-user experience rather than the accuracy of the software code's performance, which leads to differences in how game software is developed.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\">{{cite arXiv | last1 = Politowski | first1= Cristiano | first2= Fabio |last2= Petrillo | first3= Yann-G\u00e4el |last3 = Gu\u00e9h\u00e9neuc | title = A Survey of Video Game Testing | eprint=2103.06431  | date = 2021 | class= cs.SE }}</ref>\n\nBecause game development is focused on the presentation and gameplay as seen by the player, there often is little rigor in maintaining and testing backend code in early stages of development since such code may be readily disregarded if there are changes found in gameplay. Some [[Test automation|automated testing]] may be used to assure the core game engine operates as expected, but most game testing comes via [[game tester]], who enter the testing process once a playable prototype is available. This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> The use of testers may be lightweight at the early stages of development, but the testers' role becomes more predominant as the game nears completion, becoming a full-time role alongside development.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Early testing is considered a key part of game design; the most common issue raised in several published post-mortems on game development was the failure to start the testing process early.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nAs code matures and the gameplay features solidify, then development typically includes more rigorous test controls such as [[regression testing]] to make sure new updates to the code base do not change working parts of the game. Games are complex software systems, and changes in one code area may unexpected cause a seemingly unrelated part of the game to fail. Testers are tasked to repeatedly play through updated versions of games in these later stages to look for any issues or bugs not otherwise found from automated testing. Because this can be a monotonous task of playing the same game over and over, this process can lead to games frequently being released with uncaught bugs or glitches.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nThere are other factors simply inherent to video games that can make testing difficult. This includes the use of randomized gameplay systems, which require more testing for both game balance and bug tracking than more linearized games, the balance of cost and time to devote to testing as part of the development budget, and assuring that the game still remains fun and entertaining to play as changes are made to it.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> \n\nDespite the dangers of overlooking regression testing, some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs. This can result in customers dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals. When this does happen, most developers and publishers quickly release [[Patch (computing)|patches]] that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> Certain publishing models are designed specifically to accommodate the fact that first releases of games may be bug-ridden but will be fixed post-release. The [[early access]] model invites players to pay into a game before its planned release and help to provide feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/> [[Mobile games]] and games with live services are also anticipated to be updated on a frequent basis, offset pre-release testing with live feedback and bug reports.<ref name=\"gamedev survey\"/>\n\n"}, {"title": " Milestones ", "content": "[[File:Software_dev2.svg|thumb|right|200px|Video game development milestones follow a similar process as with other software development.]]\n\nCommercial game development projects may be required to meet milestones set by publisher.<!--244--> Milestones mark major events during game development and are used to track game's progress.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}} Such milestones may be, for example, ''first playable'',{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244\u2013245}} ''alpha'',{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=294}}{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}} or ''beta''{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=245}}  game versions.<!--The refs mention these being milestones, not just mention versions.--> Project milestones depend on the developer schedules.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}}\n\nMilestones are usually based on multiple short descriptions for functionality; examples may be \"Player roaming around in game environment\" or \"Physics working, collisions, vehicle\" etc. (numerous descriptions are possible).  These milestones are usually how the developer gets paid; sometimes as \"an advance against royalty\". These milestones are listed, anywhere from three to twenty depending on developer and publisher.  The milestone list is usually a collaborative agreement between the publisher and developer.  The developer usually advocates for making the milestone descriptions as simple as possible; depending on the specific publisher - the milestone agreements may get very detailed for a specific game.  When working with a good publisher, the \"spirit of the law\" is usually adhered to regarding milestone completion... in other words if the milestone is 90% complete the milestone is usually paid with the understanding that it will be 100% complete by the next due milestone.  It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer, and usually (but not always) the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met.  Also, sometimes milestones are \"swapped\", the developer or publisher may mutually agree to amend the agreement and rearrange milestone goals depending on changing requirements and development resources available.  Milestone agreements are usually included as part of the legal development contracts.  After each \"milestone\" there is usually a payment arrangement.  Some very established developers may simply have a milestone agreement based on the amount of time the game is in development (monthly / quarterly) and not specific game functionality - this is not as common as detailed functionality \"milestone lists\".\n\nThere is no industry standard for defining milestones, and such vary depending on publisher, year, or project.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=192}} Some common milestones for two-year development cycle are as follows:{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}}\n\n==== First playable ====\n\nThe ''first playable'' is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets,{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244}} this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}} It is often based on the prototype created in pre-production.{{sfn|Chandler|2009|p=244\u2013245}} Alpha and first playable are sometimes used to refer to a single milestone, however large projects require first playable before [[feature complete]] alpha.{{sfn|Bethke|2003|p=293}} First playable occurs 12 to 18 months before code release.
