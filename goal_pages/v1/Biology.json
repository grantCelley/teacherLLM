[[Metabolism]] is the set of [[chemical reactions]] in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of [[metabolic waste]]s. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as [[catabolic]]\u2014the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by [[cellular respiration]]); or [[anabolic]]\u2014the building up ([[biosynthesis|synthesis]]) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into [[metabolic pathway]]s, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by [[Coupling (physics)|coupling]] them to [[spontaneous process|spontaneous reactions]] that release energy. Enzymes act as [[Catalysis|catalysts]]\u2014they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it\u2014by reducing the amount of [[activation energy]] needed to convert [[reactant]]s into [[Product (chemistry)|product]]s. Enzymes also allow the [[Metabolic pathway#Regulation|regulation]] of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.\n\n===Cellular respiration===\n{{Main|Cellular respiration}}\n\n[[Image:CellRespiration.svg|thumb|300px|Respiration in a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cell]] ]]\n\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert [[Energy#Energy and life|chemical energy]] from [[nutrients]] into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Regina|title=Cellular Respiration|url=http://biology.about.com/od/cellularprocesses/a/cellrespiration.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505043947/http://biology.about.com/od/cellularprocesses/a/cellrespiration.htm|archive-date=2012-05-05}}</ref> The reactions involved in respiration are [[catabolism|catabolic reactions]], which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are [[redox]] reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a [[combustion reaction]], it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.\n\nSugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages: [[glycolysis]], [[citric acid cycle]] (or Krebs cycle), [[electron transport chain]], and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].<ref name=\"lodish2008l\">{{cite book |last1=Lodish |first1=Harvey |last2=Berk |first2=Arnold. |last3=Kaiser |first3= Chris A.  |last4=Krieger |first4=Monty |last5=Scott |first5=Matthew P. |last6=Bretscher |first6=Anthony |last7=Ploegh |first7=Hidde |last8=Matsudaira |first8=Paul |chapter=Cellular energetics |title=Molecular Cell Biology |publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company |edition=6th |date=2008 |location=New York |pages=479\u2013532 |isbn=978-0716776017}}</ref> Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]]s, with two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time.<ref name=\"lodish2008l\"/> Each pyruvate is then oxidized into [[acetyl-CoA]] by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]], which also generates [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] and carbon dioxide. Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH<sub>2</sub>, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the [[Crista|mitochondrial cristae]]. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four [[protein complex]]es that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane ([[chemiosmosis]]), which generates a [[Chemiosmosis#Proton-motive force|proton motive force]].<ref name=\"lodish2008l\"/> Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme [[ATP synthase]] to synthesize more ATPs by [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]s. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final [[electron acceptor]].\n\nIf oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of [[fermentation]]. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to [[cellular waste product|waste products]] that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is [[lactic acid]]. This type of fermentation is called [[lactic acid fermentation]]. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD<sup>+</sup> regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen.

In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP<sup>+</sup>, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called [[photosystem I]] (PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma.

[[Neoplasm|Tumor]] cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. For example, brain cells called [[neuron]]s release ligands called [[neurotransmitter]]s that diffuse across a [[chemical synapse#Structure|synaptic cleft]] to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or [[muscle cell]]. In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the [[circulatory system]]s of animals or [[vascular system]]s of plants to reach their target cells. Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an [[Ligand-gated ion channel|inotropic receptor]] can alter the [[Cell excitability|excitability]] of a target cell. Other types of receptors include [[protein kinase]] receptors (e.g., [[Insulin receptor|receptor]] for the hormone [[insulin]]) and [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s.

Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH<sub>2</sub>, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the [[Crista|mitochondrial cristae]]. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four [[protein complex]]es that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane ([[chemiosmosis]]), which generates a [[Chemiosmosis#Proton-motive force|proton motive force]].<ref name=\"lodish2008l\"/> Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme [[ATP synthase]] to synthesize more ATPs by [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]s. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final [[electron acceptor]].\n\nIf oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of [[fermentation]]. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to [[cellular waste product|waste products]] that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is [[lactic acid]]. This type of fermentation is called [[lactic acid fermentation]]. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD<sup>+</sup> regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD<sup>+</sup> attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide.

The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a [[quinone]] designated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP<sup>+</sup>, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called [[photosystem I]] (PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma.

[[Neoplasm|Tumor]] cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. For example, brain cells called [[neuron]]s release ligands called [[neurotransmitter]]s that diffuse across a [[chemical synapse#Structure|synaptic cleft]] to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or [[muscle cell]]. In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the [[circulatory system]]s of animals or [[vascular system]]s of plants to reach their target cells. Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an [[Ligand-gated ion channel|inotropic receptor]] can alter the [[Cell excitability|excitability]] of a target cell. Other types of receptors include [[protein kinase]] receptors (e.g., [[Insulin receptor|receptor]] for the hormone [[insulin]]) and [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s.

During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. [[Heterozygous|Heterozygotic]] individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, the [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Independent Assortment|law of independent assortment]], states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked.

The first is that genetic characteristics, [[allele]]s, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. Based on the [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Dominance and Uniformity|law of dominance and uniformity]], which states that some alleles are [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] while others are [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the [[phenotype]] of that dominant allele. During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. [[Heterozygous|Heterozygotic]] individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, the [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Independent Assortment|law of independent assortment]], states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule would include traits that are [[sex linkage|sex-linked]].
