Persuasion relies on appeals rather than strong pressure or [[coercion]]. The process of persuasion has been found to be influenced by numerous variables that generally fall into one of five major categories:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Myers|first=David|title=Social Psychology|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8|edition=10th|location=New York|pages=234\u2013253}}</ref>\n#[[Orator|Communication]]: includes [[credibility]], [[expert]]ise, [[trustworthiness]], and [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].\n#[[Message]]: includes varying degrees of [[reason]], [[emotion]] (e.g., fear), one-sided or two-sided arguments, and other types of informational content.\n#[[Audience]]: includes a variety of [[demographics]], [[personality trait]]s, and [[preference]]s.\n# [[Media (communication)|Medium]]: includes printed word, radio, television, the internet, or face-to-face interactions.\n#Context: includes environment, group dynamics, and preliminary information.\n\n[[File:Elm-diagram.jpg|thumb|469x480px|The Elaboration Likelihood Model is an influential model of persuasion]]\n\n[[Dual process theory|Dual-process theories]] of persuasion (such as the [[elaboration likelihood model]]) maintain that persuasion is mediated by two separate routes: central and peripheral.

Individuals also attribute causes of behavior to controllable and uncontrollable factors (i.e., how much control one has over the situation at hand).\n\nNumerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered. For instance, the [[fundamental attribution error]] is the bias towards make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior.<ref name=\"Myers\">\n{{cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|url=https://archive.org/details/psychology8thedit00myer|title=Psychology|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2007|edition=8|location=New York|url-access=limited|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>{{rp|724}} The actor-observer bias is an extension of the theory, positing that tendency exists to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for one's own.<ref name=\"Aaronson1\" />{{rp|107}} The [[self-serving bias]] is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened.

The [[availability heuristic]] occurs when people estimate the [[probability]] of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or difficult to understand. The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of.<ref name=\"Aaronson1\" />{{rp|63}} Several other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The [[hindsight bias]] is a [[Confabulation|false memory]] of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The [[confirmation bias]] is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.<ref>{{Citation|title=Availability Bias, Source Bias, and Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis|work=Methods of Meta-Analysis: Correcting Error and Bias in Research Findings|year=2015|pages=513\u2013551|publisher=SAGE Publications, Ltd|doi=10.4135/9781483398105.n13|isbn=978-1-4522-8689-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Schemas ====\n{{Main|Schema (psychology)}}\n[[Schema (psychology)|Schemas]] are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. They organize social information and experiences. Schemas often operate [[automaticity|automatically]] and unconsciously. This leads to biases in perception and memory. Schemas may induce expectations that lead us to see something that is not there.

These selves are part of one's identity and the self-referential information is that which relies on the appropriate self to process and react to it.\n\nThere are many theories on the perception of our own behavior. [[Leon Festinger]]'s 1954 ''[[social comparison theory]]'' posits that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|author-link=Leon Festinger|year=1954|title=A theory of social comparison process|journal=[[Human Relations (journal)|Human Relations]]|volume=7|issue=2|pages=117\u201340|doi=10.1177/001872675400700202|via=SAGE Journals|s2cid=18918768}}</ref> [[Daryl Bem]]'s 1972 ''self-perception theory'' claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bem|first=Daryl J.|title=Self Perception Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1972|isbn=978-0-12-015206-3|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=6|pages=1\u201362|chapter=Self-Perception Theory|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60024-6|author-link=Daryl Bem}}</ref>\n\n=== Social influence ===\n{{Main|Social influence}}\nSocial influence is an overarching term that denotes the persuasive effects people have on each other. It is seen as a fundamental concept in social psychology. The study of it overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include [[conformity]], [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most effects of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Vuong|first1=Quan-Hoang|title=Mindsponge Theory|date=2023|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=9788367405140}}</ref>\n\nThe first major area of social influence is conformity. Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group (i.e., status), similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variations among group members play a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.<ref name=\"Aaronson2\"/>{{rp|27}} Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.<ref name=\"Aaronson2\">\n{{cite book|last=Aronson|first=Elliot|title=The Social Animal|title-link=The Social Animal (Aronson book)|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4292-0316-6|edition=10th|author-link=Elliot Aronson|orig-year=1972}}</ref>{{rp|15}}\n\nThe second major area of social influence research is [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], which refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person. The [[foot-in-the-door technique]] is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with a larger favor (e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars). A related trick is the [[bait and switch]], which is a disingenuous sales strategy that involves enticing potential customers with advertisements of low-priced items which turn out to be unavailable in order to sell a more expensive item.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=R.B|year=2000|title=Influence: Science and Practice|publisher=[[Allyn and Bacon]]}}</ref>\n\nThe third major form of social influence is [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the [[Milgram study]], wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.<ref name=\"Aaronson2\" />{{rp|41}}\n\nAn unusual kind of social influence is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. This is a prediction that, by being made, causes itself to become true. For example, in the financial field, if it is widely believed that a [[stock market crash|crash]] is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus cause a crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and induce this hostility by their own behavior.<ref name=\"Aaronson1\" />{{rp|18}}\n\nPsychologists have spent decades studying the power of social influence, and the way in which it manipulates people's opinions and behavior. Specifically, social influence refers to the way in which individuals change their ideas and actions to meet the demands of a social group, received authority, social role, or a minority within a group wielding influence over the majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologistworld.com/influence/social-influence|title=Social Influence {{!}} Psychology of Influence|last=Waude|first=Adam|date=20 July 2017|website=Psychologist World|access-date=8 April 2019|archive-date=8 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408045245/https://www.psychologistworld.com/influence/social-influence|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Group dynamics===\n{{Main|Group dynamics}}\n\n[[File:Soc-psy diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Social psychologists study interactions within [[social group|groups]], and between both groups and individuals.]]\n\nSocial psychologists study group-related phenomena such as the behavior of [[crowd]]s.

These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups.\n\nThe tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=1986|title=The Social Identity Theory of Intergroup Behavior|editor1-last=S.

Groups also affect performance and [[productivity]].

The more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more likely they will be attracted to each other.<ref>Byrne, Donn.

Careful attention to research design, sampling, and [[statistics|statistical analysis]] is important in social psychology.\n\nWhenever possible, social psychologists rely on [[Scientific control|controlled experimentation]], which requires the manipulation of one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] in order to examine the effect on a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in [[internal validity]], meaning that they are free from the influence of [[confounding]] or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in [[external validity]], or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control (internal validity) and being able to generalize to the population (external validity).\n\nBecause it is usually impossible to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] of persons from the wider [[population]]. Social psychologists frequently use [[Statistical survey|survey]] research when they are interested in results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]] to obtain a sample of respondents that is representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or [[correlation]]al because there is no experimental control over variables.

At the end of the study, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task, while the group of participants were paid $20 to tell the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group, being paid only $1 was not sufficient incentive. This led them to experience dissonance, or discomfort and internal conflict. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies. They did this by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provided a reason for doing the boring task, which resulted in no dissonance.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html|title=Cognitive Dissonance|last=McLeod|first=Saul|date=5 February 2018|website=Simply Psychology|access-date=7 October 2013|archive-date=17 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917075409/http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Festinger|first1=Leon|last2=Carlsmith|first2=James M.|year=1959|title=Cognitive consequences of forced compliance|journal=[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]|volume=58|issue=2|pages=203\u201311|citeseerx=10.1.1.497.2779|doi=10.1037/h0041593|pmid=13640824}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Milgram experiment]]: The experimenter (E) persuades the participant (T) to give what the participant believes are painful electric shocks to another participant (L), who is actually an actor.

As hypothesized, the children who had witnessed the aggressive actor, imitated the behavior and proceeded to act aggressively towards the doll. Both male and female children who witnessed the non-aggressive actor behaved less aggressively towards the doll. However, boys were more likely to exhibit aggression, especially after observing the behavior from an actor of the same gender. In addition, boys were found to imitate more physical aggression, while girls displayed more verbal aggression.\n\n=== Ethics ===\nThe goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize [[deception]] to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and other techniques that help remove potential obstacles to participation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=APA PsycNet |url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-11699-019 |access-date=2022-04-30 |website=psycnet.apa.org |language=en |archive-date=30 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220430013156/https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-11699-019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=What about concealment of the existence or purpose of observation?}}\n\nThe practice of deception has been challenged by psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical and that other research strategies (e.g., [[role-playing]]) should be used instead. Research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies, and this has cast doubt on their validity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Role Playing: An Alternative to Deception?

At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or [[institutional review board]], which examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to come to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people participating.\n\nFurthermore, a process of [[informed consent]] is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will be asked of them in the experiment{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=How, if there will be portions of the experiment that involve deception?}} and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A [[debriefing]] is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=And what would the response be if they weren't?

For one, questionable research practices have been identified as common. Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, often involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample sizes, or data management systems, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones.<ref name=\"Simmons et al. (2011)\"/> Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of these practices are prevalent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/questionable-research-practices-surprisingly-common.html|title=Questionable Research Practices Surprisingly Common {{!}} News|date=2012|website=[[Association for Psychological Science]]|access-date=30 May 2014|archive-date=31 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105054/http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/questionable-research-practices-surprisingly-common.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSome social psychologists have also published fraudulent research that has entered into mainstream academia, most notably the admitted data fabrication by [[Diederik Stapel]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shea|first=Christopher|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746/|title=Fraud Scandal Fuels Debate Over Practices of Social Psychology|date=13 November 2011|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=24 April 2020|archive-date=5 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705054842/http://www.chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as allegations against others.
