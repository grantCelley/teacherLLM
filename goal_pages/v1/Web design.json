The different areas of web design include web graphic design; [[user interface design]] (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and [[proprietary software]]; [[user experience design]] (UX design); and [[search engine optimization]]. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.<ref name=\"different jobs\">{{cite web|last=Lester|first=Georgina|title=Different jobs and responsibilities of various people involved in creating a website|url=https://www.arts-wales.co.uk/different-jobs-and-responsibilities-of-various-people-involved-in-creating-a-website/|access-date=2012-03-17|publisher=Arts Wales UK}}</ref> The term \"web design\" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing [[markup language|markup]]. Web design partially overlaps [[web engineering]] in the broader scope of [[web development]].

The web was announced on August 6, 1991; in November 1992, [[CERN]] was the first website to go live on the World Wide Web. During this period, websites were structured by using the <nowiki><table> tag which created numbers on the website.

In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as [[Netscape Communications]], the [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape 0.9 browser]]. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with [[HTML element#Tables|tables]] on web pages. From 1996 to 1999 the [[browser wars]] began, as [[Microsoft]] and [[Netscape]] fought for ultimate browser dominance.

At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good markup structure, little attention was paid to semantics and [[web accessibility]].

However, because Flash required a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to GIF animations (if they did not forego using [[motion graphics]] altogether) and JavaScript for [[software widget|widgets]].

Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know-how nor the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.\n\n=== Progressive enhancement ===\n[[File:Progressive enhancement web design pyramid (HTML, CSS, JS).svg|thumb|The order of progressive enhancement]]\n{{main article|Progressive enhancement}}\n'''Progressive enhancement''' is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on [[web content]] first, allowing [[Universal design|everyone to access]] the basic content and functionality of a web page, whilst [[user (computing)|users]] with additional browser features or faster Internet access receive the enhanced version instead.\n\nIn practice, this means serving content through [[HTML]] and applying styling and animation through [[CSS]] to the technically possible extent, then applying further enhancements through [[JavaScript]]. Pages' text is loaded immediately through the HTML source code rather than having to wait for JavaScript to initiate and load the content subsequently, which allows content to be readable with minimum loading time and bandwidth, and through [[text-based browser]]s, and maximizes [[backwards compatibility]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Building a resilient frontend using progressive enhancement |url=https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement |website=GOV.UK |access-date=27 October 2021 |language=en}}</ref> \n\nAs an example, [[MediaWiki]]-based sites including Wikipedia use progressive enhancement, as they remain usable while JavaScript and even CSS is deactivated, as pages' content is included in the page's HTML source code, whereas counter-example Everipedia relies on JavaScript to load pages' content subsequently; a blank page appears with JavaScript deactivated.\n\n=== Page layout ===\nPart of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the [[page layout]].  For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout.  Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of [[aesthetics]] on larger screens.\n\n'''Fluid layouts''' increased in popularity around 2000 to allow the browser to make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts based on the details of the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window, etc.). They grew as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and [[Grid (page layout)|grid-based design]] in both page layout design principles and in coding technique but were very slow to be adopted.<ref group=\"note\" ><code>&lt;table&gt;</code>-based markup and [[spacer .GIF]] images</ref> This was due to considerations of [[Screen reader|screen reading devices]] and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, [[Web banner|embedded advertising]] areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below [[body text]] rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.\n\n[[Responsive web design]] is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's style sheet through an enhanced use of the CSS <code>@media</code> rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html|title=Rolling out mobile-first indexing|work=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}</ref> Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main|typography}}\nWeb designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of [[typeface]]s or [[Typeface#Style of typefaces|type styles]]. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.\n\nFont downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10, and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in [[web typography]], as well as the usage of font downloading.\n\nMost site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stone|first=John|title=20 Do's and Don'ts of Effective Web Typography| url=http://webdesignledger.com/tips/20-dos-and-donts-of-effective-web-typography|access-date=2012-03-19|date=2009-11-16}}</ref>\n\n===Motion graphics===\nThe page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, [[motion graphic design]] may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.\n\nMotion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html World Wide Web Consortium: Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide]</ref>\n\n=== Quality of code ===\nWebsite designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error-prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well as making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, a more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly coded pages are sometimes colloquially called [[tag soup]]. [[W3C Markup Validation Service|Validating via W3C]]<ref name=\"W3C_validator\" /> can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.<ref>{{cite web|last=W3C QA|title=My Web site is standard! And yours?| url=http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality|access-date=2012-03-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Generated content ===\nThere are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.\n\n==== Static websites ====\n{{Main|Static web page}}\nA static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as [[Jekyll (software)|Jekyll]] and [[Adobe Muse]].<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Christensen| first = Mathias Biilmann\n  | title = Static Website Generators Reviewed: Jekyll, Middleman, Roots, Hugo\n  | website= Smashing Magazine| access-date = 2016-10-26| date = 2015-11-16\n  | url = https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/\n}}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. This advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and [[virtual machine|virtual server]]s offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.\n\nAlmost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and style sheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.\n\n==== Dynamic websites ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page}}\nDynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate web pages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalog or to summarise numeric information, and others may use a [[document database]] such as [[MongoDB]] or [[NoSQL]] to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.\n\nIn the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or [[website wireframe|wireframe]]d using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static page, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.\n\nWhen dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page, and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.\n\nBoth of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as [[content management system]]s.  These build on top of general-purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well-recognised models, such as a time-sequenced [[blog]], a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki, or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organizational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.\n\nEditing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is [[Wikipedia]].\n\n=== Technical Communication in Web Design ===\nIn a study regarding good practices in technical communication, the authors explore the aspects of good technical communication. They outline their method of measurement called the communication coefficient, which is a number representing the effectiveness in the communication of complex technical ideas. They specifically state three philosophies that they believe lead to good technical communication:\n\n# '''Philosophy 1:''' The way that we communicate affects how others perceive our work. They perceive our work as more valid and useful when we communicate it well and less so when we communicate it poorly.\n# '''Philosophy 2:''' Individuals judge communication quality based on a host of personal factors, including their experiences, preferences, technical background, linguistic background, and membership in professional groups.\n# '''Philosophy 3:''' Communication matters during all interpersonal interactions, to varying degrees.\n\nThe authors do not give clear indication of specific application, however they give a clear and concise framework for effective technical communication.\n\nIn an additional study regarding privacy policies, the authors present an alternative to the privacy agreement. They propose a more visual, user based approach as opposed to the classic long worded privacy agreements. Such an approach involves \u201cprivacy ratings\u201d that pertain to categories and are clearly hierarchically represented. Such a representation makes it clear what information is being shared and how secure a website is in a more user friendly manner. Their results show a generally positive response from their sample group and outline the usefulness of such a structure in website design.\n\n", "goals": ["The student will be able to design a website that is accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing", "The student will be able to design a website that is accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing", "The student will be able to design a website that is accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing", "The student will be able to design a website that is accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing", "The student will be able to design a website that is accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing"]}, {"title": " Marketing and communication design ", "content": "Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market.

This advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and [[virtual machine|virtual server]]s offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.\n\nAlmost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and style sheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.\n\n==== Dynamic websites ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page}}\nDynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate web pages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalog or to summarise numeric information, and others may use a [[document database]] such as [[MongoDB]] or [[NoSQL]] to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.\n\nIn the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or [[website wireframe|wireframe]]d using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static page, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.\n\nWhen dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page, and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.\n\nBoth of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as [[content management system]]s.  These build on top of general-purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well-recognised models, such as a time-sequenced [[blog]], a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki, or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organizational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.\n\nEditing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is [[Wikipedia]].\n\n", "goals": ["The student will be able to define and differentiate between static and dynamic websites", "The student will be able to identify the benefits of static websites", "The student will be able to identify the benefits of dynamic websites", "The student will be able to identify the different ways dynamic websites are generated", "The student will be able to identify the different types of databases used by dynamic websites"]}, {"title": " Dynamic websites ", "content": "{{Main|Dynamic web page}}\nDynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate web pages.
