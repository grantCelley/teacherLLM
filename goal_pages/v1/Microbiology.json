[[Prions]], never considered as microorganisms, have been investigated by virologists, however, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections, virologists took a search\u2014discovering \"infectious proteins\".\n\nThe existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were first observed, for example by the [[Jainism|Jains]] in India and by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ancient Rome. The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds, by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1666, but the Jesuit priest [[Athanasius Kircher]] was likely the first to see microbes, which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] is considered a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|father of microbiology]] as he observed and experimented with [[microscopic organisms]] in the 1670s, using simple [[microscope]]s of his design. Scientific microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] and in medical microbiology [[Robert Koch]].\n\n", "sections": []}
