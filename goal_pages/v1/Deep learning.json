More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial ''credit assignment path'' (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a [[feedforward neural network]], the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For [[recurrent neural network]]s, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.<ref name=\"SCHIDHUB\" /> No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CqQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA15|title=Human Behavior and Another Kind in Consciousness: Emerging Research and Opportunities: Emerging Research and Opportunities|last=Shigeki|first=Sugiyama|date=12 April 2019|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-5225-8218-2|language=en}}</ref> Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network.

Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually [[Labeled data|labeled]] as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using [[rule-based programming]].\n\nAn ANN is based on a collection of connected units called [[artificial neuron]]s, (analogous to biological [[neuron]]s in a [[Brain|biological brain]]). Each connection ([[synapse]]) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by [[real numbers]], typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.\n\nTypically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as [[backpropagation]], or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.\n\nNeural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, [[general game playing|playing board and video games]] and medical diagnosis.\n\nAs of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Silver|first1=David|last2=Huang|first2=Aja|last3=Maddison|first3=Chris J.|last4=Guez|first4=Arthur|last5=Sifre|first5=Laurent|last6=Driessche|first6=George van den|last7=Schrittwieser|first7=Julian|last8=Antonoglou|first8=Ioannis|last9=Panneershelvam|first9=Veda|s2cid=515925|date=January 2016|title=Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search|journal=Nature|volume=529|issue=7587|pages=484\u2013489|doi=10.1038/nature16961|issn=1476-4687|pmid=26819042|bibcode=2016Natur.529..484S}}</ref>).\n\n=== Deep neural networks ===\nA deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers.<ref name=\"BENGIODEEP\" /><ref name=\"SCHIDHUB\" /> There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.<ref name=\"Nokkada\">{{citation |title=A Guide to Deep Learning and Neural Networks |url=https://serokell.io/blog/deep-learning-and-neural-network-guide#components-of-neural-networks |access-date=2020-11-16 |archive-date=2020-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102151103/https://serokell.io/blog/deep-learning-and-neural-network-guide#components-of-neural-networks |url-status=live }}</ref> These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\nFor example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed.

Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.\n\nDNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1.

Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.\n\nDNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1.

Practically, the DNN is trained as a [[Classifier (machine learning)|classifier]] that maps an input [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] or [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] X to an output [[probability distribution]] over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in [[image classification]] tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of [[pixels]]' color values to probabilities over possible image classes.

This system has contributed to [[materials science]] by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic [[crystal structure]]s. The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the [[Materials Project]] database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development.

Like the [[neocortex]], neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of [[transducer]]s, well-tuned to their operating environment.
