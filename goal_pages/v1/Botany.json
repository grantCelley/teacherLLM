A '''botanist''', '''plant scientist''' or '''phytologist''' is a [[scientist]] who specialises in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} (''{{Lang|grc-latn|botan\u0113}}'') meaning \"[[pasture]]\", \"[[herb]]s\" \"[[Poaceae|grass]]\", or \"[[fodder]]\"; {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} is in turn derived from {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} ({{transl|grc|boskein}}), \"to feed\" or \"to [[Grazing|graze]]\".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1940}}{{sfn|Gordh|Headrick|2001|p = 134}}{{sfn|Online Etymology Dictionary|2012}}  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of [[fungi]] and [[algae]] by [[mycologists]] and [[phycologists]] respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the [[International Botanical Congress]]. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 [[species]] of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] of which some 391,000 species are [[vascular plant]]s (including approximately 369,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s),{{sfn|RGB Kew|2016}} and approximately 20,000 are [[bryophyte]]s.{{sfn|The Plant List||2013}}\n\nBotany originated in prehistory as [[herbalism]] with the efforts of early humans to identify \u2013 and later cultivate \u2013 plants that were edible, poisonous, and possibly medicinal, making it one of the first endeavours of human investigation. Medieval [[physic garden]]s, often attached to [[Monastery|monasteries]], contained plants possibly having medicinal benefit. They were forerunners of the first [[botanical garden]]s attached to [[University|universities]], founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]]. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of [[plant taxonomy]], and led in 1753 to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system of nomenclature]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]] that remains in use to this day for the naming of all biological species.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of [[optical microscope|optical microscopy]] and [[live cell imaging]], [[electron microscopy]], analysis of [[ploidy|chromosome number]], [[phytochemistry|plant chemistry]] and the structure and function of [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of [[molecular biology|molecular genetic analysis]], including [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] and [[DNA sequences]] to classify plants more accurately.\n\nModern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with contributions and insights from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]] and differentiation, [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]], [[plant physiology#Biochemistry of plants|biochemistry]] and [[metabolism|primary metabolism]], chemical products, [[Plant morphology#Morphology in development|development]], [[plant pathology|diseases]], [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|plant taxonomy]]. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are [[molecular genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], which study the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of [[plant cell]]s and [[Tissue (biology)#Plant tissue|tissues]]. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing [[staple foods]], materials such as [[Lumber|timber]], [[oil]], rubber, [[Fiber|fibre]] and drugs, in modern [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], [[plant propagation]], [[Plant breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic modification]], in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in [[environmental management]], and the maintenance of [[biodiversity]].\n\n", "sections": [{"title": " History ", "content": "{{Main|History of botany}}\n\n=== Early botany ===\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|alt=engraving of cork cells from Hooke's Micrographia, 1665|An engraving of the cells of [[Cork oak|cork]], from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 275\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Renaissance C14 F\u00fcllmaurer Leonhart Fuchs.jpg\n | width1            = 700\n | height1           = 828\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Leonhart Fuchs]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Brunfels-1.png\n | width2            = 700\n | height2           = 828\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Otto Brunfels]]\n<!--image 3-->\n | image3            = Hieronymus Bock (1546).jpg\n | width3            = 700\n | height3           = 828\n | alt3              =\n | link3             =\n | caption3          = [[Hieronymus Bock]]\n}}\n\nBotany originated as [[herbalism]], the study and use of plants for their [[Medicinal plants|possible medicinal properties]].{{sfn|Sumner|2000|p = 16}} The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications.

These gardens continued the practical value of earlier \"physic gardens\", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for suspected medicinal uses. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens.

Bock created his own system of plant classification.\n\nPhysician [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515\u20131544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal ''Historia Plantarum'' in 1544 and a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|Sprague|1939}} Naturalist [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516\u20131565) and herbalist [[John Gerard]] (1545\u2013{{circa|1611}}) published herbals covering the supposed medicinal uses of plants.

In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}}\n\n=== Early modern botany ===\n{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)#History of taxonomy}}\n[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a garden|The [[Linnaean Garden]] of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted according to his ''Systema sexuale''.]]\n\nDuring the 18th century, systems of [[plant identification]] were developed comparable to [[single access key|dichotomous keys]], where unidentified plants are placed into [[taxon]]omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of [[Character (biology)|characters]]. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ([[single access key#Diagnostic ('artificial') versus synoptic ('natural') keys|diagnostic keys]]) or more closely related to the natural or [[taxonomic order|phyletic order]] of the [[taxon|taxa]] in synoptic keys.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp = 73\u2013117}} By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus]] published his [[Species Plantarum]], a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|modern botanical nomenclature]]. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the [[genus]] and the second identified the [[species]] within the genus.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 220\u2013223}} For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's ''Systema Sexuale'' [[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification of plants|classified]] plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p = 9}}\n\nIncreasing knowledge of [[plant anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. [[Michel Adanson|Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The [[Candollean system]] reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later [[Bentham & Hooker system]], which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s publication of the ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.{{sfn|Starr|2009|pp =299\u2013}}\n\nBotany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first \"modern\" textbook, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundz\u00fcge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 377}}  Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the [[cell theory]] with [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] and was among the first to grasp the significance of the [[cell nucleus]] that had been described by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.{{sfn|Harris|2000|pp = 76\u201381}} In 1855, [[Adolf Fick]] formulated [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's laws]] that enabled the calculation of the rates of [[molecular diffusion]] in biological systems.{{sfn|Small|2012|pp =118\u2013}}\n\n[[File:Echeveria glauca II.jpg|thumb|''Echeveria glauca'' in a Connecticut greenhouse.

This beneficial effect is also known as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Once outcrossing is established, subsequent switching to inbreeding becomes disadvantageous since it allows expression of the previously masked deleterious recessive mutations, commonly referred to as inbreeding depression.  \n\nUnlike in higher animals, where [[parthenogenesis]] is rare, [[asexual reproduction]] may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem [[tuber]]s in potato is one example. Particularly in [[arctic]] or [[alpine climate|alpine]] habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers [[zoophily|by animals]] are rare, plantlets or [[bulbs]], may develop instead of flowers, replacing [[sexual reproduction]] with asexual reproduction and giving rise to [[cloning|clonal populations]] genetically identical to the parent. This is one of several types of [[apomixis]] that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a [[seed]], producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.{{sfn|Savidan|2000|pp = 13\u201386}}\n\nMost sexually reproducing organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their [[chromosome number]] may occur due to errors in [[cytokinesis]]. This can occur early in development to produce an [[autopolyploid]] or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid ([[endopolyploidy]]), or during gamete formation. An [[allopolyploid]] plant may result from a [[hybridization event|hybridisation event]] between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are [[reproductively isolated]] from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new [[sympatric speciation|species]].{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce [[vegetative propagation|vegetatively]] or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495\u2013496}} [[Durum]] wheat is a fertile [[tetraploid]] allopolyploid, while [[common wheat|bread wheat]] is a fertile [[hexaploid]].

Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as [[genus|genera]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]] \u2013 grouping organisms by ancestry rather than [[phenotype|superficial characteristics]]. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) and administered by the [[International Botanical Congress]].{{sfn|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2011|p = Preamble, para. 7}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}}\n\nKingdom [[Plant]]ae belongs to [[Domain (biology)|Domain]] [[Eukaryota]] and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]] (or Division); [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]] (plural ''genera''); [[Species]]. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}} For example, the tiger lily is ''[[Lilium columbianum]]''. ''Lilium'' is the genus, and ''columbianum'' the [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]]. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013555}}{{sfn|International Association for Plant Taxonomy|2006}}{{sfn|Silyn-Roberts|2000|p = 198}}\n\nThe evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]].

They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless [[cactus]] such as an ''[[Echinocactus]]''.

Some [[euphorbia]]s have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The [[Cladistics|cladistic method]] takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history \u2013 such as those evolved separately in different groups ([[homoplasies]]) or those left over from ancestors ([[plesiomorphies]]) \u2013 and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ([[apomorphies]]). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as [[cladogram]]s: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 442\u2013450}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses molecular characters, particularly [[DNA]] sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. [[Clive A. Stace|Clive Stace]] describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\"{{sfn|Stace|2010a|p = 104}} As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals.
