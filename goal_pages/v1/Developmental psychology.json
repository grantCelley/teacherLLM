During the oral stage, the child finds pleasure in behaviors like sucking or other behaviors with the mouth. The second is the ''anal stage'', from about a year or a year and a half to three years of age. During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with its defecation. This period of development often occurs during the time when the child is being toilet trained. The child becomes interested with feces and urine. Children begin to see themselves as independent from their parents. They begin to desire assertiveness and autonomy.\n\nThe third is the ''[[phallic stage]]'', which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age). During the phallic stage, the child becomes aware of its sexual organs. Pleasure comes from finding acceptance and love from the opposite sex. The fourth is the ''latency stage'', which occurs from age five until puberty.

In his interview techniques with children that formed an empirical basis for his theories, he used something similar to [[Socratic questioning]] to get children to reveal their thinking. He argued that a principal source of development was through the child's inevitable generation of contradictions through their interactions with their physical and social worlds. The child's resolution of these contradictions led to more integrated and advanced forms of interaction, a developmental process that he called, \"equilibration.\" \n\nPiaget argued that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages generated through the equilibration process. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step. He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process. He proposed four stages: ''sensorimotor'', ''pre-operational'', ''concrete operational'', and ''formal operational''.

Successful resolution of the dilemma results in the person ingraining a positive virtue, but failure to resolve the fundamental challenge of that stage reinforces negative perceptions of the person or the world around them and the person's personal development is unable to progress.<ref name =\"Orenstein\"/>\nThe first stage, \"Trust vs. Mistrust\", takes place in infancy. The positive virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning whom to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her. The second stage is \"Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt\" with the positive virtue being will. This takes place in early childhood when the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of whereas if the child is overly controlled, feelings of inadequacy are reinforced, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubt.\n\nThe third stage is \"Initiative vs. Guilt\". The virtue of being gained is a sense of purpose. This takes place primarily via play. This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids. They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows. If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with their world and other children in it.\n\nThe fourth stage is \"Industry (competence) vs. Inferiority\". The virtue for this stage is competency and is the result of the child's early experiences in school. This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and understand the value of their accomplishments.\n\nThe fifth stage is \"Identity vs. Role Confusion\". The virtue gained is fidelity and it takes place in adolescence. This is when the child ideally starts to identify their place in society, particularly in terms of their gender role.\n\nThe sixth stage is \"Intimacy vs. Isolation\", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love. This is when the person starts to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionally. Not doing so can reinforce feelings of isolation.\n\nThe seventh stage is \"Generativity vs. Stagnation\". This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained is care. A person becomes stable and starts to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community.\n\nThe eighth stage is \"Ego Integrity vs. Despair\". When one grows old, they look back on their life and contemplate their successes and failures. If they resolve this positively, the virtue of wisdom is gained. This is also the stage when one can gain a sense of closure and accept death without regret or fear.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Mcleod S |date=2013 |title=[Erik Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development] |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity===\n{{Main|Model of hierarchical complexity}}\n[[Michael Commons]] enhanced and simplified [[B\u00e4rbel Inhelder]] and Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development. The Model of Hierarchical Complexity (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks. A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to seventeen stages. The stages are:\n\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Calculatory]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Automatic]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Sensory & Motor]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Circular sensory-motor]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Sensory-motor]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Nominal]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Sentential]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Preoperational]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Primary]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Concrete]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Abstract]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Formal]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Systematic]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Metasystematic]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Paradigmatic]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Cross-paradigmatic]]\n# [[Model of hierarchical complexity|Meta-Cross-paradigmatic]]\n\nThe order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98.\n\nIn the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hierarchical Complexity - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/hierarchical-complexity#:~:text=The%20Model%20of%20Hierarchical%20Complexity%20%20%20,invertebrates,%20hone%20...%20%2013%20more%20rows |access-date=2022-07-27 |website=www.sciencedirect.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological systems theory===\n{{Main|Ecological systems theory}}\n[[File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|thumb|{{center|Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory}}]]\nEcological systems theory, originally formulated by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem. Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://explorable.com/ecological-systems-theory|title=Ecological Systems Theory|website=Explorable Psychology Experiments| vauthors = Sincero SM }}</ref>\n\nThe microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting). The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason). Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).<ref name=\"Edpsych24\"/>\n\nSince its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development'',<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Bronfenbrenner U | date = 1979 | title = The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | isbn = 0-674-22457-4}}</ref> has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments.

Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others. Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.<ref name=\"Edpsych24\"/> A foundational concept of constructivism is that the purpose of cognition is to organize one's experiential world, instead of the ontological world around them.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=1998-08-13 |editor-last=Larochelle |editor-first=Marie |editor2-last=Bednarz |editor2-first=Nadine |editor3-last=Garrison |editor3-first=Jim |title=Constructivism and Education |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511752865 |journal=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/cbo9780511752865|isbn=978-0-521-62135-9 }}</ref>\n\nJean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems.

This is often referred to as \"[[nature and nurture]]\" or [[psychological nativism|nativism]] versus [[empiricism]]. A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's [[genes]].<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Khalidi MA |date=2002|title=Nature and Nurture in Cognition|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3541766|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=53|issue=2|pages=251\u2013272|doi=10.1093/bjps/53.2.251|jstor=3541766|issn=0007-0882}}</ref> What makes a person who they are?

Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarized positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences. One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental psychology]].\n\nOne area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on [[language acquisition]]. A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through [[learning]]. The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning in language acquisition|statistical learning]]. From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as [[perceptual learning]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sameroff A | title = A unified theory of development: a dialectic integration of nature and nurture | journal = Child Development | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 6\u201322 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20331651 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01378.x }}</ref>\n\nThe nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a [[universal grammar]] that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified. This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]]. Chomsky's critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generally.<ref name=\"Schlinger\">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Schlinger HD |year=2008 |title=The long good-bye: why B.F.

The child's resolution of these contradictions led to more integrated and advanced forms of interaction, a developmental process that he called, \"equilibration.\" \n\nPiaget argued that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages generated through the equilibration process. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step.

Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills. Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities. His theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal.\n\nOther accounts, such as that of [[Lev Vygotsky]], have suggested that development does not progress through stages, but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finality. Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously. Thus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtain.\n\n[[K.

However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of [[domain-specific]] information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms.\n\n===Social and emotional development===\n{{Main|Social-emotional development in childhood|Social psychology}}\nDevelopmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies. For example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops. Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior.\n\n[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotional regulation]] or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts. In young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figures. As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state.

This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or [[norm (sociology)|normative]]) and occur in most members of a cohort. As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.<ref>[http://www.jweducation.com/PhDabstractsummary.html A Longitudinal Study of Early Literacy Development and the Changing Perceptions of Parents and Teachers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429145255/http://www.jweducation.com/PhDabstractsummary.html |date=2011-04-29 }}, John Worthington, 2001</ref>\n\nResearchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data.

Also, because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation, apparently normative developmental trends may, in fact, be universal only to their cohort.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|40}}\n\nIn a [[cross-sectional study]], a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time. This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method, and because the individuals come from different cohorts, shared historical events are not so much of a [[lurking variable|confounding factor]].

Instead, infants continued to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the \"[[A-not-B error]]\". Some researchers have suggested that before the age of 8-9 months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone (\"Out of sight, out of mind\").\n\n====Recent findings in infant cognition====\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, researchers developed new methods of assessing infants' understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time. Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought.\n\nBased on recent findings, some researchers (such as [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Renee Baillargeon]]) have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all, but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our species.\n\nAccording to Jean Piaget's developmental psychology, object permanence, or the awareness that objects exist even when they are no longer visible, was thought to emerge gradually between the ages of 8 and 12 months. However, experts such as Elizabeth Spelke and Renee Baillargeon have questioned this notion. They studied infants' comprehension of object permanence at a young age using novel experimental approaches such as violation-of-expectation paradigms. These findings imply that children as young as 3 to 4 months old may have an innate awareness of object permanence. Baillargeon's \"drawbridge\" experiment, for example, showed that infants were surprised when they saw occurrences that contradicted object permanence expectations. This proposition has important consequences for our understanding of infant cognition, implying that infants may be born with core cognitive abilities rather than developing them via experience and learning.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Meltzoff |first1=Andrew N. |title=Learning about the mind from evidence |date=2013-08-22 |work=Understanding Other Minds |pages=19\u201334 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199692972.003.0002 |access-date=2024-04-02 |publisher=Oxford University Press |last2=Gopnik |first2=Alison|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199692972.003.0002 |isbn=978-0-19-969297-2 }}</ref>\n\nOther research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them, including:\n* an early [[numerical cognition]], that is, an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations;<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wynn K | title = Addition and subtraction by human infants | journal = Nature | volume = 358 | issue = 6389 | pages = 749\u2013750 | date = August 1992 | pmid = 1508269 | doi = 10.1038/358749a0 | s2cid = 4348056 | bibcode = 1992Natur.358..749W | author-link1 = Karen Wynn }}</ref>\n* an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment;<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodward AL | title = Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach | journal = Cognition | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201334 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9871370 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00058-4 | s2cid = 3081461 }}</ref>\n* an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leslie AM, Keeble S | title = Do six-month-old infants perceive causality? | journal = Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 265\u2013288 | date = April 1987 | pmid = 3581732 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80006-9 | s2cid = 29558332 }}</ref>\n\n===Critical periods of development===\nThere are [[critical period]]s in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual, sensorimotor, social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation.<ref name=\"Siegler\">{{Cite book | vauthors = Siegler R |year=2006 |title=How Children Develop, Exploring Child Development Student Media Tool Kit & Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-6113-6}}</ref> [[Feral child]]ren such as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood.

There still may be differences in developmentally delayed (DD) children vs. typical development (TD) behavioral, emotional and other mental disorders. When compared to MA children there is a bigger difference between normal developmental behaviors overall. DDs can cause lower MA, so comparing DDs with TDs may not be as accurate. Pairing DDs specifically with TD children at similar MA can be more accurate. There are levels of behavioral differences that are considered as normal at certain ages. When evaluating DDs and MA in children, consider whether those with DDs have a larger amount of behavior that is not typical for their MA group. Developmental delays tend to contribute to other disorders or difficulties than their TD counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Caplan B, Neece CL, Baker BL | title = Developmental level and psychopathology: comparing children with developmental delays to chronological and mental age matched controls | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 37 | pages = 143\u2013151 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25498740 | pmc = 4314378 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2014.10.045 }}</ref>\n\n===Toddlerhood===\n{{Main|Toddler}}\nInfants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood.

It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity (see [[Erik Erikson]]) and the discovery of moral purpose (see [[William Damon]]). Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning. A return to [[egocentric]] thought often occurs early in the period. Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood. (Huitt, W. and Hummel, J. January 1998)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pages.uoregon.edu/moursund/Math/developmental_theory.htm|title=Developmental Theory|website=pages.uoregon.edu|access-date=2021-05-07|archive-date=2021-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516005242/https://pages.uoregon.edu/moursund/Math/developmental_theory.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nErik Erikson labels this stage identity versus role confusion. Erikson emphasizes the importance of developing a sense of identity in adolescence because it affects the individual throughout their life. Identity is a lifelong process and is related with curiosity and active engagement. Role confusion is often considered the current state of identity of the individual. Identity exploration is the process of changing from role confusion to resolution.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Syed |first=Moin |date=July 2013 |title=Identity exploration, identity confusion, and openness as predictors of multicultural ideology |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176713000576 |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=491\u2013496 |doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2013.04.005 |via=ELSEVIER}}</ref>\n\nDuring Erik Erikson's identity versus role uncertainty stage, which occurs in adolescence, people struggle to form a cohesive sense of self while exploring many social roles and prospective life routes. This time is characterized by deep introspection, self-examination, and the pursuit of self-understanding. Adolescents are confronted with questions regarding their identity, beliefs, and future goals. The major problem is building a strong sense of identity in the face of society standards, peer pressure, and personal preferences. Adolescents participate in identity exploration, commitment, and synthesis, actively seeking out new experiences, embracing ideals and aspirations, and merging their changing sense of self into a coherent identity. Successfully navigating this stage builds the groundwork for good psychological development in adulthood, allowing people to pursue meaningful relationships, make positive contributions to society, and handle life's adversities with perseverance and purpose.<ref name=\":4\" />  \n\nIt is divided into three parts, namely:\n# Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years \n# Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and\n# Late Adolescence: 15 to 18 years\n\nThe adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as \"Who am I? Who do I want to be?\" Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become [[autonomous]], and commit to an [[identity (social science)|identity]], or [[sense of self]]. Different roles, behaviors and [[ideologies]] must be tried out to select an identity. Role confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through, for example, friends.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kemph |first=John P. |date=March 1969 |title=Erik H.

Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages. A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop. If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on others.\n\n''Isolation,'' on the other hand, suggests something different than most might expect. Erikson defined it as a delay of commitment in order to maintain freedom. Yet, this decision does not come without consequences. Erikson explained that choosing isolation may affect one's chances of getting married, progressing in a career, and overall development.<ref>{{Cite book |last=\u017dukauskien\u0117 |first=Rita |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYs0CwAAQBAJ&dq=%22early+adulthood%22+development&pg=PA17 |title=Emerging Adulthood in a European Context |date=2015-12-07 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-317-61271-1 |language=en}}</ref> \n\nA related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of [[emerging adulthood]]. Scholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development.

If a person falls into despair, they are often disapointed about failures or missed chances in life.

Previous research generalizes the findings done with W.E.I.R.D. samples because many in the Psychological field assume certain aspects of development are exempted from or are not affected by life experiences. However, many of the assumptions have been proven incorrect or are not supported by empirical research. For example, according to Kohlberg, moral reasoning is dependent on cognitive abilities. While both analytical and holistic cognitive systems do have the potential to develop in any adult, the West is still on the extreme end of analytical thinking, and the non-West tend to use holistic processes. Furthermore, moral reasoning in the West only considers aspects that support autonomy and the individual, whereas non-Western adults emphasize moral behaviors supporting the community and maintaining an image of holiness or divinity.
