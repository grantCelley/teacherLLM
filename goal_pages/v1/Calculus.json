Berkeley famously described infinitesimals as the [[ghosts of departed quantities]] in his book ''[[The Analyst]]'' in 1734.  Working out a rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians for much of the century following Newton and Leibniz, and is still to some extent an active area of research today.<ref name=\"Bell-SEP\">{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/ |title=Continuity and Infinitesimals |date=2013-09-06 |website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |first=John L. |last=Bell |access-date=2022-02-20 |author-link=John Lane Bell |archive-date=16 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220316170134/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral mathematicians, including [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]], tried to prove the soundness of using infinitesimals, but it would not be until 150 years later when, due to the work of [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], a way was finally found to avoid mere \"notions\" of infinitely small quantities.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |author-link=Bertrand Russell |year=1946 |title=History of Western Philosophy |location=London |publisher=[[George Allen & Unwin Ltd]] |page=[https://archive.org/stream/westernphilosoph035502mbp#page/n857/mode/2up 857] |quote=The great mathematicians of the seventeenth century were optimistic and anxious for quick results; consequently they left the foundations of analytical geometry and the infinitesimal calculus insecure. Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but although this belief suited his metaphysics it had no sound basis in mathematics. Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, showed how to establish calculus without infinitesimals, and thus, at last, made it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of continuity and infinite number. \"Continuity\" had been, until he defined it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics. Cantor gave a precise significance to the word and showed that continuity, as he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists. By this means a great deal of mysticism, such as that of Bergson, was rendered antiquated. |title-link= A History of Western Philosophy }}</ref> The foundations of differential and integral calculus had been laid. In Cauchy's ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', we find a broad range of foundational approaches, including a definition of [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of infinitesimals, and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]] in the definition of differentiation.<ref>{{cite book |first=Judith V. |last=Grabiner |author-link=Judith Grabiner |title=The Origins of Cauchy's Rigorous Calculus |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofcauchys00judi |url-access=registration |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-387-90527-3 }}</ref> In his work Weierstrass formalized the concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]] and eliminated infinitesimals (although his definition can validate [[nilsquare]] infinitesimals). Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities, though the subject is still occasionally called \"infinitesimal calculus\". [[Bernhard Riemann]] used these ideas to give a precise definition of the integral.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom |last=Archibald |chapter=The Development of Rigor in Mathematical Analysis |pages=117\u2013129 |title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics |title-link=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics |editor-first1=Timothy |editor-last1=Gowers |editor-link1=Timothy Gowers |editor-first2=June |editor-last2=Barrow-Green |editor-link2=June Barrow-Green |editor-first3=Imre |editor-last3=Leader |editor-link3=Imre Leader |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-11880-2 |oclc=682200048}}</ref> It was also during this period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to the [[complex plane]] with the development of [[complex analysis]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Adrian |last=Rice |chapter=A Chronology of Mathematical Events |pages=1010\u20131014 |title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics |title-link=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics |editor-first1=Timothy |editor-last1=Gowers |editor-link1=Timothy Gowers |editor-first2=June |editor-last2=Barrow-Green |editor-link2=June Barrow-Green |editor-first3=Imre |editor-last3=Leader |editor-link3=Imre Leader |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-11880-2 |oclc=682200048}}</ref>\n\nIn modern mathematics, the foundations of calculus are included in the field of [[real analysis]], which contains full definitions and [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of the theorems of calculus.

Another way is to use [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]]. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from [[mathematical logic]] to augment the real number system with [[infinitesimal]] and [[Infinity|infinite]] numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called [[hyperreal number]]s, and they can be used to give a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph W. |last=Daubin |chapter=Abraham Robinson |pages=822\u2013823 |title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics |title-link=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics |editor-first1=Timothy |editor-last1=Gowers |editor-link1=Timothy Gowers |editor-first2=June |editor-last2=Barrow-Green |editor-link2=June Barrow-Green |editor-first3=Imre |editor-last3=Leader |editor-link3=Imre Leader |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-11880-2 |oclc=682200048}}</ref> There is also [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates neglecting higher-power infinitesimals during derivations.<ref name=\"Bell-SEP\"/> Based on the ideas of [[F. W. Lawvere]] and employing the methods of [[category theory]], smooth infinitesimal analysis views all functions as being [[continuous function|continuous]] and incapable of being expressed in terms of [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities. One aspect of this formulation is that the [[law of excluded middle]] does not hold.<ref name=\"Bell-SEP\" /> The law of excluded middle is also rejected in [[constructive mathematics]], a branch of mathematics that insists that proofs of the existence of a number, function, or other mathematical object should give a construction of the object.

Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of continuity and infinite number. \"Continuity\" had been, until he defined it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics. Cantor gave a precise significance to the word and showed that continuity, as he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists.

Historically, the first method of doing so was by [[infinitesimal]]s. These are objects which can be treated like real numbers but which are, in some sense, \"infinitely small\".  For example, an infinitesimal number could be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and thus less than any positive [[real number]]. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. The symbols <math>dx</math> and <math>dy</math> were taken to be infinitesimal, and the derivative <math>dy/dx</math> was their ratio.<ref name=\"Bell-SEP\" />\n\nThe infinitesimal approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. In the late 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced within academia by the [[epsilon, delta]] approach to [[Limit of a function|limits]]. Limits describe the behavior of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby inputs. They capture small-scale behavior using the intrinsic structure of the [[real number|real number system]] (as a [[metric space]] with the [[least-upper-bound property]]). In this treatment, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by sequences of smaller and smaller numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of a function is found by taking the limiting behavior for these sequences. Limits were thought to provide a more rigorous foundation for calculus, and for this reason, they became the standard approach during the 20th century. However, the infinitesimal concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of [[non-standard analysis]] and [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.<ref name=\"Bell-SEP\"/>\n\n=== Differential calculus ===\n{{Main|Differential calculus}}\n[[File:Tangent line to a curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.35 |Tangent line at {{math|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>))}}. The derivative {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'')}} of a curve at a point is the slope (rise over run) of the line tangent to that curve at that point.]]\n\nDifferential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the [[derivative]] of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called ''differentiation''. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the ''derivative function'' or just the ''derivative'' of the original function. In formal terms, the derivative is a [[linear operator]] which takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to produce another function. The function produced by differentiating the squaring function turns out to be the doubling function.<ref name=\"TMU\">{{Cite book |last1=Frautschi |first1=Steven C. |title=The Mechanical Universe: Mechanics and Heat |title-link=The Mechanical Universe |last2=Olenick |first2=Richard P. |last3=Apostol |first3=Tom M. |last4=Goodstein |first4=David L. |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-71590-4 |edition=Advanced |location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire] |oclc=227002144 |author-link=Steven Frautschi |author-link3=Tom M.

The \"derivative\" now takes the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, defined by the expression \"{{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}}\", as an input, that is all the information\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to output another function, the function {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}, as will turn out.\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the symbol for a derivative is an [[apostrophe]]-like mark called a [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. Thus, the derivative of a function called {{math|''f''}} is denoted by {{math|''f\u2032''}}, pronounced \"f prime\" or \"f dash\". For instance, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is the squaring function, then {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} is its derivative (the doubling function {{math|''g''}} from above).\n\nIf the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change concerning time. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is a function that takes time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of {{math|''f''}} is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the [[velocity]] of the ball.<ref name=\"TMU\"/>{{Rp|18\u201320}}\n\nIf a function is [[linear function|linear]] (that is if the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, where {{math|''x''}} is the independent variable, {{math|''y''}} is the dependent variable, {{math|''b''}} is the ''y''-intercept, and:\n\n:<math>m= \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}= \\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.</math>\n\nThis gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book |last1=Salas |first1=Saturnino L. |title=Calculus; one and several variables |last2=Hille |first2=Einar |date=1971 |publisher=Xerox College Pub. |location=Waltham, MA |oclc=135567}}</ref>{{Rp|page=6}} If the graph of the function is not a straight line, however, then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies. Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output concerning change in input. To be concrete, let {{math|''f''}} be a function, and fix a point {{math|''a''}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}}. {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} is a point on the graph of the function. If {{math|''h''}} is a number close to zero, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is a number close to {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}} is close to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}. The slope between these two points is\n\n:<math>m = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{(a+h) - a} = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is called a ''[[difference quotient]]''. A line through two points on a curve is called a ''secant line'', so {{math|''m''}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}. The second line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point {{math|'' a''}} because it does not account for what happens between {{math|'' a''}} and {{math|'' a'' + ''h''}}. It is not possible to discover the behavior at {{math|'' a''}} by setting {{math|''h''}} to zero because this would require [[dividing by zero]], which is undefined. The derivative is defined by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero, meaning that it considers the behavior of {{math|''f''}} for all small values of {{math|''h''}} and extracts a consistent value for the case when {{math|''h''}} equals zero:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0}{f(a+h) - f(a)\\over{h}}.</math>\n\nGeometrically, the derivative is the slope of the [[tangent line]] to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|'' a''}}.

One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a [[Riemann sum]]) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.\n\nWhen velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given time interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time.  For example, traveling a steady 50&nbsp; mph for 3 hours results in a total distance of 150 miles.  Plotting the velocity as a function of time yields a rectangle with a height equal to the velocity and a width equal to the time elapsed.  Therefore, the product of velocity and time also calculates the rectangular area under the (constant) velocity curve.<ref name=\":5\"/>{{rp|535}}  This connection between the area under a curve and the distance traveled can be extended to ''any'' irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating velocity over a given period. If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled between the times represented by {{math|'' a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is the area of the region between {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and the {{math|''x''}}-axis, between {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}}.\n\nTo approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between {{math|'' a''}} and {{math|''b''}} into several equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol {{math|\u0394''x''}}. For each small segment, we can choose one value of the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. Call that value {{math|''h''}}. Then the area of the rectangle with base {{math|\u0394''x''}} and height {{math|''h''}} gives the distance (time {{math|\u0394''x''}} multiplied by speed {{math|''h''}}) traveled in that segment.   Associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''}}. The sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for {{math|\u0394''x''}} will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact answer, we need to take a limit as {{math|\u0394''x''}} approaches zero.<ref name=\":5\"/>{{rp|512\u2013522}}\n\nThe symbol of integration is <math>\\int </math>, an [[long s|elongated ''S'']] chosen to suggest summation.<ref name=\":5\" />{{Rp|pages=529}} The definite integral is written as:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nand is read \"the integral from ''a'' to ''b'' of ''f''-of-''x'' with respect to ''x''.\" The Leibniz notation {{math|'' dx''}} is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles so that their width {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes the infinitesimally small {{math|'' dx''}}.<ref name=\"TMU\"/>{{Rp|44}}\n\nThe indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:\n\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nFunctions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative of a given function is a family of functions differing only by a constant.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|page=326}} Since the derivative of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''C''}}, where {{math|''C''}} is any constant, is {{math|''y\u2032'' {{=}} 2''x''}}, the antiderivative of the latter is given by:\n:<math>\\int 2x\\, dx = x^2 + C.</math>\nThe unspecified constant {{math|'' C''}} present in the indefinite integral or antiderivative is known as the [[constant of integration]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=William |last1=Moebs |first2=Samuel J. |last2=Ling |first3=Jeff |last3=Sanny |display-authors=etal |title=University Physics, Volume 1 |publisher=OpenStax |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-947172-20-3 |oclc=961352944}}</ref>{{rp|135}}\n\n=== Fundamental theorem ===\n{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}\nThe [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|page=290}} More precisely, it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals.

Historically, the first method of doing so was by [[infinitesimal]]s. These are objects which can be treated like real numbers but which are, in some sense, \"infinitely small\".  For example, an infinitesimal number could be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and thus less than any positive [[real number]]. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. The symbols <math>dx</math> and <math>dy</math> were taken to be infinitesimal, and the derivative <math>dy/dx</math> was their ratio.<ref name=\"Bell-SEP\" />\n\nThe infinitesimal approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. In the late 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced within academia by the [[epsilon, delta]] approach to [[Limit of a function|limits]]. Limits describe the behavior of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby inputs. They capture small-scale behavior using the intrinsic structure of the [[real number|real number system]] (as a [[metric space]] with the [[least-upper-bound property]]). In this treatment, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by sequences of smaller and smaller numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of a function is found by taking the limiting behavior for these sequences. Limits were thought to provide a more rigorous foundation for calculus, and for this reason, they became the standard approach during the 20th century. However, the infinitesimal concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of [[non-standard analysis]] and [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.<ref name=\"Bell-SEP\"/>\n\n", "goals": ["The student will be able to define and understand the concept of an infinitesimal, and understand how it was used in the development of calculus", "The student will be able to define and understand the concept of a limit, and understand how it was used in the development of calculus", "The student will be able to define and understand the concept of a function, and understand how it was used in the development of calculus", "The student will be able to define and understand the concept of a real number, and understand how it was used in the development of calculus", "The student will be able to define and understand the concept of a metric space, and understand how it was used in the development of calculus"]}, {"title": " Differential calculus ", "content": "{{Main|Differential calculus}}\n[[File:Tangent line to a curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.35 |Tangent line at {{math|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>))}}.

The process of finding the derivative is called ''differentiation''. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the ''derivative function'' or just the ''derivative'' of the original function. In formal terms, the derivative is a [[linear operator]] which takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to produce another function. The function produced by differentiating the squaring function turns out to be the doubling function.<ref name=\"TMU\">{{Cite book |last1=Frautschi |first1=Steven C. |title=The Mechanical Universe: Mechanics and Heat |title-link=The Mechanical Universe |last2=Olenick |first2=Richard P. |last3=Apostol |first3=Tom M. |last4=Goodstein |first4=David L. |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-71590-4 |edition=Advanced |location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire] |oclc=227002144 |author-link=Steven Frautschi |author-link3=Tom M.

Thus, the derivative of a function called {{math|''f''}} is denoted by {{math|''f\u2032''}}, pronounced \"f prime\" or \"f dash\". For instance, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is the squaring function, then {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} is its derivative (the doubling function {{math|''g''}} from above).\n\nIf the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change concerning time. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is a function that takes time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of {{math|''f''}} is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the [[velocity]] of the ball.<ref name=\"TMU\"/>{{Rp|18\u201320}}\n\nIf a function is [[linear function|linear]] (that is if the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, where {{math|''x''}} is the independent variable, {{math|''y''}} is the dependent variable, {{math|''b''}} is the ''y''-intercept, and:\n\n:<math>m= \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}= \\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.</math>\n\nThis gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book |last1=Salas |first1=Saturnino L. |title=Calculus; one and several variables |last2=Hille |first2=Einar |date=1971 |publisher=Xerox College Pub. |location=Waltham, MA |oclc=135567}}</ref>{{Rp|page=6}} If the graph of the function is not a straight line, however, then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies.

A line through two points on a curve is called a ''secant line'', so {{math|''m''}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}. The second line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point {{math|'' a''}} because it does not account for what happens between {{math|'' a''}} and {{math|'' a'' + ''h''}}. It is not possible to discover the behavior at {{math|'' a''}} by setting {{math|''h''}} to zero because this would require [[dividing by zero]], which is undefined. The derivative is defined by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero, meaning that it considers the behavior of {{math|''f''}} for all small values of {{math|''h''}} and extracts a consistent value for the case when {{math|''h''}} equals zero:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0}{f(a+h) - f(a)\\over{h}}.</math>\n\nGeometrically, the derivative is the slope of the [[tangent line]] to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|'' a''}}.

One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a [[Riemann sum]]) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.\n\nWhen velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given time interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time.  For example, traveling a steady 50&nbsp; mph for 3 hours results in a total distance of 150 miles.  Plotting the velocity as a function of time yields a rectangle with a height equal to the velocity and a width equal to the time elapsed.  Therefore, the product of velocity and time also calculates the rectangular area under the (constant) velocity curve.<ref name=\":5\"/>{{rp|535}}  This connection between the area under a curve and the distance traveled can be extended to ''any'' irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating velocity over a given period. If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled between the times represented by {{math|'' a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is the area of the region between {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and the {{math|''x''}}-axis, between {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}}.\n\nTo approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between {{math|'' a''}} and {{math|''b''}} into several equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol {{math|\u0394''x''}}. For each small segment, we can choose one value of the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. Call that value {{math|''h''}}. Then the area of the rectangle with base {{math|\u0394''x''}} and height {{math|''h''}} gives the distance (time {{math|\u0394''x''}} multiplied by speed {{math|''h''}}) traveled in that segment.   Associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''}}. The sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for {{math|\u0394''x''}} will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact answer, we need to take a limit as {{math|\u0394''x''}} approaches zero.<ref name=\":5\"/>{{rp|512\u2013522}}\n\nThe symbol of integration is <math>\\int </math>, an [[long s|elongated ''S'']] chosen to suggest summation.<ref name=\":5\" />{{Rp|pages=529}} The definite integral is written as:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nand is read \"the integral from ''a'' to ''b'' of ''f''-of-''x'' with respect to ''x''.\" The Leibniz notation {{math|'' dx''}} is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles so that their width {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes the infinitesimally small {{math|'' dx''}}.<ref name=\"TMU\"/>{{Rp|44}}\n\nThe indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:\n\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nFunctions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative of a given function is a family of functions differing only by a constant.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|page=326}} Since the derivative of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''C''}}, where {{math|''C''}} is any constant, is {{math|''y\u2032'' {{=}} 2''x''}}, the antiderivative of the latter is given by:\n:<math>\\int 2x\\, dx = x^2 + C.</math>\nThe unspecified constant {{math|'' C''}} present in the indefinite integral or antiderivative is known as the [[constant of integration]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=William |last1=Moebs |first2=Samuel J. |last2=Ling |first3=Jeff |last3=Sanny |display-authors=etal |title=University Physics, Volume 1 |publisher=OpenStax |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-947172-20-3 |oclc=961352944}}</ref>{{rp|135}}\n\n", "goals": ["The student will be able to define and use the concept of the definite integral and the indefinite integral, and understand the difference between them", "The student will be able to apply the concept of the definite integral to calculate the area under a curve, and understand the concept of the Riemann sum", "The student will be able to apply the concept of the indefinite integral to find the antiderivative of a given function, and understand the concept of the constant of integration", "The student will be able to apply the concept of the definite integral to calculate the distance traveled in a given time, and understand the concept of the Riemann sum", "The student will be able to apply the concept of the indefinite integral to find the antiderivative of a given function, and understand the concept of the constant of integration"]}, {"title": " Fundamental theorem ", "content": "{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}\nThe [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|page=290}} More precisely, it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals.

Calculus is also used to find approximate solutions to equations; in practice, it is the standard way to solve differential equations and do root finding in most applications. Examples are methods such as [[Newton's method]], [[fixed point iteration]], and [[linear approximation]]. For instance, spacecraft use a variation of the [[Euler method]] to approximate curved courses within zero gravity environments.\n\n[[Physics]] makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]] are related through calculus. The [[mass]] of an object of known [[density]], the [[moment of inertia]] of objects, and the [[potential energy|potential energies]] due to gravitational and electromagnetic forces can all be found by the use of calculus. An example of the use of calculus in mechanics is [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]], which states that the derivative of an object's [[momentum]] concerning time equals the net [[force]] upon it. Alternatively, Newton's second law can be expressed by saying that the net force equals the object's mass times it's [[acceleration]], which is the time derivative of velocity and thus the second time derivative of spatial position. Starting from knowing how an object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Garber|title=The language of physics: the calculus and the development of theoretical physics in Europe, 1750\u20131914|date=2001|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-7272-4 |oclc=921230825}}</ref>\n\nMaxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] are also expressed in the language of differential calculus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Graham|date=2008|title=Maxwell's Electromagnetic Theory and Special Relativity|journal=Philosophical Transactions: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=366|issue=1871 |pages=1849\u20131860|doi=10.1098/rsta.2007.2192|jstor=25190792|pmid=18218598 |bibcode=2008RSPTA.366.1849H|s2cid=502776|issn=1364-503X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Gbur|first=Greg|title=Mathematical Methods for Optical Physics and Engineering|date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-511-91510-9|location=Cambridge|oclc=704518582|author-link=Greg Gbur}}</ref>{{Rp|pages=52\u201355}} Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W. |title=Chemical principles: the quest for insight|last2=Jones|first2=Loretta|date=2010|publisher=W.H.
