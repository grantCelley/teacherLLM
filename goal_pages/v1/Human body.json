The human body has four [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] (two arms and two legs), a head and a [[neck]], which connect to the [[torso]]. The body's shape is determined by a strong [[human skeleton|skeleton]] made of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]], surrounded by fat ([[adipose tissue]]), muscle, [[connective tissue]], organs, and other structures. The [[Vertebral column|spine]] at the back of the skeleton contains the flexible [[vertebral column]], which surrounds the [[spinal cord]], which is a collection of nerve fibres connecting the [[human brain|brain]] to the rest of the body. [[Nerve]]s connect the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. All major bones, muscles, and nerves in the body are named, with the exception of [[anatomical variation]]s such as [[sesamoid bone]]s and [[accessory muscle]]s.\n\nBlood vessels carry blood throughout the body, which moves because of the beating of the [[heart]]. [[Venule]]s and [[vein]]s collect blood low in oxygen from tissues throughout the body. These collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body's two largest veins, the [[superior vena cava|superior]] and [[inferior vena cava]], which drain blood into the right side of the heart. From here, the blood is pumped into the [[lung]]s where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped into the body's largest [[artery]], the [[aorta]], and then progressively smaller arteries and [[arteriole]]s until it reaches tissue. Here, blood passes from small arteries into [[capillaries]], then small veins and the process begins again. Blood carries [[oxygen]], waste products, and [[hormone]]s from one place in the body to another. Blood is filtered at the [[kidney]]s and [[liver]].\n\nThe body consists of a number of [[body cavity|body cavities]], separated areas which house different organ systems. The brain and [[central nervous system]] reside in an area protected from the rest of the body by the [[blood brain barrier]]. The lungs sit in the [[pleural cavity]]. The [[intestine]]s, [[liver]], and [[spleen]] sit in the [[abdominal cavity]].\n\nHeight, weight, [[Body shape|shape]] and other [[body proportions]] vary individually and with age and sex.

In the 17th century, [[William Harvey]] (1578\u20131657) described the [[circulatory system]], pioneering the combination of close observation with careful experiment.<ref>{{Cite journal | first=Carl | last=Zimmer | author-link=Carl Zimmer| title=Soul Made Flesh: The Discovery of the Brain \u2013 and How It Changed the World | journal=J Clin Invest | year=2004 | volume=114 | issue=5 | pages=604 | doi=10.1172/JCI22882| pmc=514597 }}</ref> In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate with the [[cell theory]] of [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] in 1838, that organisms are made up of cells. [[Claude Bernard]] (1813\u20131878) created the concept of the ''[[milieu interieur]]'' (internal environment), which [[Walter Cannon]] (1871\u20131945) later said was regulated to a steady state in [[homeostasis]]. In the 20th century, the physiologists [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] and [[George Bartholomew (biologist)|George Bartholomew]] extended their studies to [[comparative physiology]] and [[ecophysiology]].<ref>{{Cite book| last=Feder | first=Martin E. | title=New directions in ecological physiology | year=1987 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-34938-3 }}</ref> Most recently, [[evolutionary physiology]] has become a distinct subdiscipline.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Theodore Jr. | last1=Garland | author1-link=Theodore Garland, Jr. | last2=Carter | first2=P.
