These are the tests for the learning goals. We want to rewrite them and remove duplicates

What could possibly go wrong?

Well here is a list:
* The goal is not mesurable.
* The goal is continues over a sentance
* The goal has multiple action verbs
* The goal is a duplicate
* The goal is too broad
* The goal is not gramatically correct
* The goal should be broken down into smaller parts
* The goal is too unrealistic with time
* The goal does not makes sense in the context of the course
* the goal is too specific on how it is implemented
